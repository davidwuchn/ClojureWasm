## What it is

ClojureWasm is a Clojure runtime written from scratch in Zig and Clojure, with
no JVM. It builds to a small native binary (arm64 / amd64) that starts in
milliseconds. Its main feature is a **WebAssembly FFI**: from your Clojure code
you can load a module compiled from another language — Rust, Go, Zig, C — and
call it like an ordinary function. The idea is to stay in the Clojure world and
still use what other languages have already built.

## Features

- **Small and quick to start** — about 3.8 MB, starting in ~5 ms, which suits
  short-lived, start-and-stop workloads (CLI tools, serverless, scripts).
- **A lot of everyday Clojure runs** — `clojure.core` plus a growing set of
  standard-library namespaces (`clojure.string` / `set` / `walk` / `zip` /
  `edn` / `data.json` / `data.csv` / `math` / `pprint` / `test` / `tools.cli` …).
- **A CIDER-compatible nREPL** — `cljw nrepl` and connect your editor to
  evaluate real Clojure live.
- **WebAssembly as an FFI** — `(wasm/load "mod.wasm")` then
  `(wasm/call m "fn" …)`: a sandboxed module from any language, called like a
  namespace. The FFI runs **JIT-compiled by default** (the embedded zwasm engine),
  so a hot loop inside a module executes as native code.
- **WebAssembly components as namespaces** — `(:require ["comp.wasm" :as c])`
  pulls a WIT-typed component in like a library; its exports become ordinary Vars,
  with arguments and results as plain Clojure data (see below).
- **Single-binary builds** — `cljw build script.clj -o app` compiles your
  program (and the runtime) into one self-contained executable.

## Quickstart

Build the optimized, Wasm-enabled binary (needs Zig 0.16 — `direnv allow` loads
it via Nix, or `nix develop`):

```sh
zig build -Dwasm -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe   # → ./zig-out/bin/cljw
```

Then (the examples assume `cljw` is on your `PATH`):

```sh
# Call a WebAssembly module compiled from another language, like a function
cljw -e '(wasm/call (wasm/load "docs/examples/wasm/add.wasm") "add" 40 2)'   # => 42

# Evaluate an expression
cljw -e '(->> (range) (filter even?) (take 5))'     # => (0 2 4 6 8)

# Run a file
cljw script.clj

# A REPL — and an nREPL for CIDER / your editor
cljw
cljw nrepl --port 7888

# Compile a program to a single self-contained native binary
cljw build script.clj -o app
```

## Require a Wasm component like a namespace

The headline feature. A **WebAssembly component** — a `.wasm` that carries its own
WIT type signature — can be `:require`-d like a Clojure library. Its exports become
ordinary Vars, and because the component describes its own types, arguments and
return values are plain Clojure data with no hand-written glue.

Build a component from any language that targets the component model (here Rust,
`cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2`), then require the `.wasm` by name:

```clojure
(ns my.app
  (:require ["typed_payload.wasm" :as tp]))   ; required like a lib

(tp/process {:xs [3 4 5] :label "data"})
;; => {:xs [3 4 5 12], :label "data!"}
```

The WIT `record` arrived as a map, `list` as a vector, `string` as a string — and
the parameter name survives as metadata, so the export reads like a normal fn:

```clojure
(:arglists (meta #'tp/process))   ;; => ([input])
```

JVM Clojure calls Java and ClojureScript calls JavaScript; here the host is a
language-neutral `.wasm`, so a function from Rust, Go, or C is indistinguishable
from a Clojure one.

## Try it live

- **Playground** — <https://cw-playground.fly.dev> — run Clojure in your browser,
  evaluated in-process by `cljw`; call sandboxed Rust / Go WebAssembly modules
  over the FFI. ([source](https://github.com/clojurewasm/cw-playground))
- **Bookshelf demo** — <https://cw-serverless-demo.fly.dev> — a small multi-user
  bookshelf served end-to-end by `cljw`'s own HTTP server, with SQLite and
  book-cover colours running in-process through the WebAssembly FFI, no JVM.
