//! Bytecode opcode set and per-chunk container for the VM backend.
//!
//! The VM backend (ADR-0005) runs alongside the TreeWalk backend.
//! Both must produce bit-for-bit identical Values under
//! `Evaluator.compare` (ADR-0022); the opcode semantics therefore
//! mirror TreeWalk's observable behaviour rather than introducing a
//! new evaluation model.
//!
//! This module holds the data shape: the `Opcode` enum (special
//! forms, collection literals, namespace ops, exception handling,
//! and method dispatch), per-instruction side-tables on
//! `BytecodeChunk`, and the immutable chunk container. The compiler
//! (`vm/compiler.zig`) emits these; the dispatch loop (`vm.zig`)
//! consumes them.
