//! Node — the analyser's typed AST.
//!
//! `Form` (`form.zig`) is the literal surface representation a Reader
//! produces. `Node` is the post-analysis tree where every symbol has
//! been resolved to a Var or a local slot index, and every special
//! form has its own struct so the backend can dispatch on it via
//! type-safe `switch`.
//!
//! ### Scope (this file)
//!
//! - Literal: `constant` (lifted Form atom — nil / bool / int / float /
//!   string / keyword reified into a `Value` at analyse time)
//! - References: `local_ref` (let-bound; carries a slot index), `var_ref`
//!   (resolved `*const Var`)
//! - Special forms: `def`, `if`, `do`, `quote`, `fn*`, `let*`,
//!   `loop*`, `recur`, `try`, `throw` (Phase 3.9 added the last four)
//! - Expressions: `call` — generic invocation
//!
//! ### `try` / `loop*` deliberate divergences from v1 / Clojure JVM
//!
//! - **Multi-catch**: stored as a flat `[]const CatchClause` in a single
//!   `try_node`, not as nested `try_node`s the way v1 builds them. This
//!   keeps the AST shape readable and matches the way Clojure JVM stores
//!   `catchExprs` as a `PersistentVector`. See ADR / survey
//!   `private/notes/phase3-3.9-survey.md` for the rationale.
//! - **`recur_target_depth: u32` on Scope** (in `analyzer.zig`) tracks
//!   the nesting depth of the nearest `loop*` / `fn*`. Dispatch only
//!   uses "≠ 0" (target present), but the depth is preserved so future
//!   work (named loops, labelled break) can reach across multiple
//!   levels without re-engineering the Scope contract (ROADMAP A2).
//!
//! ### Known limits
//!
//! - Tail-position enforcement of `recur` is checked at eval time:
//!   `recur` outside a target is a syntax error, but `recur` in a
//!   non-tail position inside a target compiles and raises at eval time.
//! - Multi-class catch (only `ExceptionInfo` is recognised; class name
//!   is stored as a string and compared at eval time).
//!
//! ### Memory ownership
//!
//! The Node tree lives in the Analyzer's per-eval arena (`runtime
//! /gc/arena.zig`). Child pointers all point inside the same arena so
//! lifetimes align — the whole tree is freed at once when the arena
//! is released. Nodes are **not** Values, so the Phase-5 GC does not
//! trace them; this is the structural reason map / vec literals lift
//! into `constant` Values rather than into Node sub-trees.
