//! Layer-0 → Layer-1+ dispatch types.
//!
//! Phase 1's `runtime/error.zig` carried `BuiltinFn` as `(args, loc)
//! Error!Value`. Phase 2 widens the signature to `(rt, env, args, loc)`
//! so that built-ins can:
//!   - reach interners / GC / vtable via `*Runtime`,
//!   - perform namespace operations via `*Env`,
//!   - report errors with a `SourceLocation`.
//!
//! `BuiltinFn` therefore moves here in Phase 2; the Phase-1 alias in
//! `error.zig` will be retired once 2.7 (TreeWalk) starts wiring real
//! built-ins. Until then both signatures coexist — `error.zig`'s
//! version is still legal Zig, just not what the analyzer or backend
//! talk to.
//!
//! Layer 0 declares only **types**; the concrete function pointers
//! land at startup, when Layer 1 (TreeWalk in §9.4 task 2.6) calls
//! `installVTable(rt, ...)`. While `Runtime.vtable == null`, `callFn`
//! must not be invoked — this is structurally enforced because the
//! only callers (built-ins) get registered in Phase 2.6+ and not before.
//!
//! Why not `pub var` for the vtable? Because then tests cannot inject
//! a mock backend, and two Runtimes cannot carry different backends.
//! `Runtime.vtable: ?VTable` solves both.
//!
//! ### Why no `expandMacro` here
//!
//! Macro expansion is **not** a Layer-0 concern. Earlier sketches put
//! `expandMacro` on this VTable, but Phase 3.7 surfaced two problems:
//! (1) macros operate on Forms, which are a Layer-1 concept that
//! `runtime/` cannot reference; (2) macros are backend-agnostic, so
//! routing them through the same vtable as `callFn` (which is
//! backend-installed) misnames the responsibility. The macro path
//! therefore lives in `eval/macro_dispatch.zig` (Layer 1) and is
//! threaded explicitly into `analyze`. See ADR 0001.
