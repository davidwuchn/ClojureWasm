//! Root-set enumeration for cw v1 mark-sweep GC per ADR-0028 §5.
//!
//! Wires the 3 entry-point root walkers that exist in cw v1 (ADR-0028
//! §5 amendment 2 / ADR-0091):
//!
//!   1. **ns_vars**       — Namespace `Var.root` + `Var.meta` +
//!                        `Var.watches` across every registered Env
//!                        (`WalkContext.envs`). `Var.watches` is reachable
//!                        ONLY here (a `var_ref` is GC-membrane-filtered).
//!   2. **thread_roots**  — per-thread execution roots, walked for the
//!                        collecting thread + every registered worker
//!                        `ThreadGcContext`: its dynamic-binding frame
//!                        chain (`env.zig current_frame`), its macro
//!                        slot (`macro_root_slot`, refusing cw v0's
//!                        `suppressCollection` escape hatch per F-002 +
//!                        F-006), its VM operand-stack frame chain
//!                        (`vm.eval` `stack[0..sp]` + `locals`), and its
//!                        in-flight fabrication self-guard
//!                        (`gc_self_guard`). Layer 0 owns the threadlocal
//!                        slots; Layer 1 (vm / analyzer) writes them via
//!                        downward import. Subsumes the former
//!                        `current_frame` (#2) + `macro_root_slot` (#7).
//!  10. **permanent_roots** — embedder-pinned Values on the GcHeap.
//!
//! Sources 3 / 4 / 8 are per-tag trace entries (registered into
//! `tag_ops.tag_trace_table` from the owning module — `tree_walk.zig`
//! / `lazy_seq.zig` / `type_descriptor.zig`) and reach via the
//! transitive trace, not via root enumeration. Sources 5 / 9 yield
//! nothing in cw v1 by construction (ProtocolFn caches don't exist;
//! CallSite holds namespace-owned pointers, not GC edges). Source 6
//! (`refer` borrows) is closed-at-construction at `env.zig:229`'s
//! `referAll` (the dupe lifts the borrowed name onto `infra_alloc`),
//! so no GC walker is needed. The RootIterator's enum slot for each
//! deferred source stays declared per the ADR for symmetry; the
//! walker body is an early return with a one-line explanation.
//!
//! The walker takes its inputs **explicitly** via `WalkContext`
//! rather than discovering Envs through a `Runtime.envs` registry.
//! Such a registry would require changing `Env.init`'s return shape
//! (currently by-value; the registry needs a stable `*Env` address),
//! so the explicit slice is the finished form here — there is no
//! auto-registry in cw v1.
