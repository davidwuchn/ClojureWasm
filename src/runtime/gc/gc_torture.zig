//! GC torture mode (D-250): force a stop-the-world collect at every Nth VM
//! back-edge safe point so a missing root surfaces DETERMINISTICALLY (a UAF on
//! the very next collect) instead of as a rare, path-dependent crash.
//!
//! This is a TEST/VALIDATION mode, NOT production auto-collection. It is armed
//! only by the `CLJW_GC_TORTURE` env var (read once at CLI startup) and stays
//! fully inert otherwise — `period == 0` is a single global load + a predicted-
//! not-taken branch on the VM's hottest path. Production threshold-driven
//! auto-collect remains gated (D-244 #4); a test-mode forced collect at a clean
//! safe point is explicitly distinct from that flip.
//!
//! Two-stage arming so torture validates STEADY-STATE user code, not core
//! bootstrap: `configure(n)` (CLI startup) records the requested period but
//! leaves the mode inert; `arm()` (called once AFTER `setupCoreAot`) activates
//! it. Core bootstrap (AOT restore + lib loading) has its own
//! namespace-creation-window concern tracked separately as D-251 — collecting
//! mid-bootstrap is out of #4a' scope, so torture deliberately skips it.
//!
//! Validation scope: the back-edge poll fires BETWEEN bytecode steps, so the
//! safepoint torture (`tick`) catches gaps in the poll-boundary root set
//! (operand stack, locals, binding frames, ns vars, macro slot, permanent
//! roots). The SEPARATE alloc-driven torture (`allocTick`, D-386) fires INSIDE
//! `gc.alloc`, so it additionally exercises the MID-OP window: a VM op whose
//! operand watermark (`ar.op_top`) or in-flight fabrication (`gc_self_guard`) is
//! not published before an allocation surfaces here as a deterministic UAF. This
//! is the validation infra the op_top register-hoist (D-386 sub-step 2) needs —
//! and a stronger check for every existing alloc site. It is armed by a
//! SEPARATE env var (`CLJW_GC_TORTURE_ALLOC`), independent of `CLJW_GC_TORTURE`,
//! and uses `root_set.active_env` (the threadlocal the VM publishes) for the
//! collect's root context.
