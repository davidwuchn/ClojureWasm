//! Mark-sweep GC heap for cw v1 — `gc_alloc` layer of the 3-layer
//! allocator boundary per ADR-0028 §2 + F-006.
//!
//! Struct shape:
//!   - `allocations` — side-table of live heap-object records (header
//!     + size + alignment); see the `GcHeap` docstring for why a
//!     side-table beats an intrusive next-pointer.
//!   - `permanent_roots` — embedder-pinned root Values (`pin` / `unpin`).
//!   - `free_pools` — per-(size, alignment) free pool head map, owned
//!     by `runtime/gc/free_pool.zig`.
//!   - `stats` — bytes_allocated / bytes_freed / alloc/collect/sweep
//!     counts + last_live_bytes.
//!   - `infra` — backing GPA allocator (per F-006 §2 layer 1) for the
//!     raw heap pages this `GcHeap` operates over.
//!   - `bytes_since_last_gc` + `threshold_bytes` — drive the adaptive
//!     `collect()` trigger per ADR-0028 §1.
//!
//! `alloc` (free-pool fast path → infra slow path), `pin` / `unpin`,
//! and `deinit` (per-tag finaliser → rawFree drain) are all landed.
//! The `collect()` orchestrator lives in `mark_sweep.zig` to keep the
//! import graph acyclic (it reaches `root_set.zig`, which imports this
//! file).
//!
//! Thread-safety (ADR-0090 §2, F-006): `gc_mutex` (a `std.Io.Mutex`,
//! locked through the `io_default` singleton because the allocator API
//! takes no `io` arg) serializes `alloc` / `pin` / `unpin` and the whole
//! `collect()` cycle (the latter brackets in `mark_sweep.collect`). It is
//! uncontended today (real threads arrive with `future` / `pmap`); the
//! global alloc lock is the foundation the `ThreadGcContext`
//! root-publication handshake (ADR-0090) builds on for collection safety.
//! Not reentrant: `alloc` never calls `collect`, and `collect` never
//! allocates, so the two lock-takers never nest.
