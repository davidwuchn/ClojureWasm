;; clojure.data — `(diff a b)` recursive data diff (D-data-diff sweep).
;;
;; Loaded by `src/lang/bootstrap.zig::loadCore` after clojure.set (this file
;; calls `clojure.set/union` / `difference` / `intersection` fully-qualified,
;; so it must load once those vars exist). JVM clojure.data dispatches via the
;; EqualityPartition + Diff protocols over Java interfaces (Set/List/Map); cw
;; v1 has no such interfaces, so the partition is a `cond` over the cljw
;; predicates (set?/map?/sequential?) and `diff-similar` a `cond` to the same
;; three shapes — observably equivalent (F-011), simpler mechanism.
;;
;; Pattern A (`(def name (fn* ...))`); `diff` is forward-declared two-step so
;; the helpers' mutual recursion through it resolves (cw v1 has no `declare`).
