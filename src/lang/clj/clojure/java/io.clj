;; clojure.java.io — polymorphic I/O utilities (ADR-0126). cljw-native shape.
;;
;; JVM clojure.java.io is built on the Coercions + IOFactory protocols extended
;; to String / nil / File / URL / Socket / byte[] / char[]. cljw cannot extend a
;; protocol to String / nil (host_interface.nativeExtendTags reaches only the 4
;; native collection interfaces, ADR-0059), so the coercion/factory entry points
;; are plain fns that dispatch on the coercible kinds with `cond`. This is the
;; documented cljw-style divergence: the surface is NOT user-extensible the way
;; JVM IOFactory is (no realistic cljw caller extends it). Errors raise `ex-info`
;; — the cljw throw idiom (the JVM IllegalArgumentException / IOException ctors
;; are catch-only reservations, not constructable; see compat_tiers.yaml).
;;
;; Cycle 2 (this file as it stands): Coercions (as-file) + file / as-relative-path
;; / delete-file / make-parents over the java.io.File host type. reader / writer /
;; input-stream / output-stream / copy land with the stream host types
;; (ADR-0126 Cycles 3-5). as-url + resource are deferred (no URL type / no
;; classpath).
