;; realizes only N, so it already terminates on an infinite source).
;; The `-*-eager` map/filter/keep/remove/drop leaves are deleted.
;; `map` — 1/2/3-coll. Multi-coll walks colls in parallel, stops at the
;; shortest (D-134). N-coll variadic (`& colls`) deferred: it needs
;; every?/identity which are later core.clj defns (def-order; fn-body
;; symbols resolve at def time), so it would need a primitive-only seq-all.

;; (`comp` runs left-to-right per element: inner xform first) + reach past to the
