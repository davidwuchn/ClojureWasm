;; clojure.walk — Phase 6.11 cycle 1 + Phase 6.16.c Group A.
;;
;; Loaded by `src/lang/bootstrap.zig::loadCore` per ADR-0032's
;; multi-file FILES table. The `walk` spine var is a Zig leaf
;; (B2 placement preserved per v5 §9.1) at
;; `src/lang/primitive/walk.zig`; `prewalk` + `postwalk` are
;; Pattern A defns below (Phase 6.16.c Group A migration —
;; previously Zig leaves in the same file).
;;
;; Self-recursive defns use the two-step pattern (`(def name nil)`
;; then `(def name (fn* ...))`) so the inner fn body's symbol
;; resolution finds the Var by the time `analyzeSymbol` runs.
;; cw v1 has no `declare` macro yet.
