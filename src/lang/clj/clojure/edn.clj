;; `read-string` is interned by `src/lang/primitive/edn.zig` as a
;; builtin-fn Var on this namespace before `loadCore` reads this file,
;; so no defn / declare is needed here. Both the 1-arity
;; `(read-string s)` and the 2-arity `(read-string opts s)`
;; (`:readers` / `:default` / `:eof`, ADR-0073 D-200) land in that
;; primitive. The reader-stream `(read)` arity is deferred.
