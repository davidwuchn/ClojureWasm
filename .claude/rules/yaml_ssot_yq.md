# Querying the YAML SSOTs with `yq` (shell-escaping + cookbook)

Auto-loaded when editing a structured YAML SSOT (`.dev/debt.yaml`,
`compat_tiers.yaml`, `placement.yaml`, `feature_deps.yaml`). Codifies the
`yq` query + shell-escaping idioms so no session re-derives them. The SSOT
for the *content* of each file is the file; this rule is the SSOT for *how
to read/edit it from a shell*.

## Flavor

**mikefarah Go `yq` v4** (NOT the python `yq`/`jq` wrapper). Confirmed
v4.53.2. Key consequences: expression syntax is jq-like but its own; `-r`
emits raw (unquoted) scalars; `-i` edits in place. Reading a shell env var
has TWO forms with a critical difference: **`strenv(NAME)` injects the value
as an opaque string; `env(NAME)` TYPE-PARSES the value as YAML first.** Use
`strenv()` for any string value — `env()` silently breaks on prose (see the
Golden rule below). This is the single most common yq footgun in this repo.

## Golden rule for shell-escaping (this is the whole trick)

1. **Single-quote the entire yq expression.** yq expressions are full of
   `|`, `()`, `[]`, `.`, `==`, `"`, and zsh-`NOMATCH` glob metachars
   (`[`, `?`, `*`). Single quotes neutralise all of it — the only safe
   default (mirrors `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § シェル実行時のクォート規則).

   ```sh
   yq -r '.active[] | select(.category == "polymorphism") | .id' .dev/debt.yaml
   ```
   Literal double-quotes for string *values* sit fine inside the single
   quotes — no escaping.

2. **Pass shell variables via `strenv(VAR)`, NEVER string-interpolation.**
   The fragile form `yq "... == \"$x\""` forces double-quoting the whole
   expression (so every `[`/`*`/`"` inside now needs escaping) and breaks
   on values containing quotes. The robust form keeps the expression
   single-quoted and injects the value out-of-band:

   ```sh
   # ✅ robust — expression stays single-quoted, value passed as strenv
   DROW="D-203" yq -r '.active[] | select(.id == strenv(DROW)) | .status' .dev/debt.yaml
   # ❌ fragile — nested quotes, breaks on metachars / quotes in $drow
   yq -r ".active[] | select(.id == \"$drow\") | .status" .dev/debt.yaml
   ```

   **`strenv()` not `env()` — this is the footgun that made yq "useless"
   for editing prose fields.** `env(VAR)` type-parses the value as YAML to
   infer its type, so a value containing two-or-more `: ` (colon-space)
   sequences — i.e. EVERY `status:` / `barrier:` / `resolution:` prose
   field in `debt.yaml` — fails YAML map parsing with
   `mapping values are not allowed in this context`, and the assignment is
   **silently dropped** (the field keeps its old value, exit non-zero).
   `strenv(VAR)` treats the value as an opaque string and is immune.
   Verified v4.53.2:

   ```sh
   # ❌ env() — dies on multi-colon prose, field UNCHANGED
   V='Part 1: foo. Part 2: bar.' yq -i '(.active[0].status) = env(V)' f.yaml
   #   → Error: yaml: line 1, column N: mapping values are not allowed …
   # ✅ strenv() — opaque string, assignment lands
   V='Part 1: foo. Part 2: bar.' yq -i '(.active[0].status) = strenv(V)' f.yaml
   ```

   Use `env(VAR)` ONLY when you deliberately want the value typed as a
   number / bool / null (rare). For ids, dates, categories, and all prose,
   `strenv(VAR)` is the default.

3. **`yq -i` (in-place) PRESERVES comments and `|-` block scalars**
   (verified v4.53.2 — header comments + every barrier block survived a
   field edit). So scalar-field updates are safe to automate:

   ```sh
   DROW="D-203" yq -i '(.active[] | select(.id == strenv(DROW)) | .last_reviewed) = "2026-06-02"' .dev/debt.yaml
   # Single-line prose field (status / one-line barrier): strenv() works —
   S='DISCHARGED 2026-06-09 — landed; Part 1: x. Part 2: y.' \
     DROW="D-356" yq -i '(.active[] | select(.id == strenv(DROW)) | .status) = strenv(S)' .dev/debt.yaml
   ```
   `strenv()` makes single-line prose assignment safe (the colon footgun is
   gone). BUT for a **new multi-line block scalar** (a fresh `barrier: |-`
   /`resolution: |-` block spanning several lines), still hand-edit with the
   Edit tool — `yq -i` emits a single-line double-quoted scalar (no `|-`
   block), so it round-trips correctly but reflows the prose onto one line
   and loses the block formatting. Use Edit when the block shape matters.

## debt.yaml cookbook (the recurring queries)

Structure: two top-level lists `active:` / `discharged:`. Active entries:
`id` / `status` / `category` / `barrier` (+ optional `quality_floor` /
`last_reviewed`). Discharged: `id` / `discharged_at` / `resolution`.

```sh
# counts
yq -r '.active | length' .dev/debt.yaml
yq -r '.discharged | length' .dev/debt.yaml

# all active ids
yq -r '.active[].id' .dev/debt.yaml

# one entry's field (escaping-free var)
DROW="D-203" yq -r '.active[] | select(.id == strenv(DROW)) | .barrier' .dev/debt.yaml

# filter by category / status substring
yq -r '.active[] | select(.category == "polymorphism") | .id' .dev/debt.yaml
yq -r '.active[] | select(.status | test("blocked-by")) | .id' .dev/debt.yaml

# quality-loop floor backlog (the F-010 drain list)
yq -r '.active[] | select(has("quality_floor")) | .id + " :: " + .quality_floor' .dev/debt.yaml

# is an id discharged? (in discharged: OR an active entry marked DISCHARGED)
DROW="D-018"; yq -r '.discharged[].id, (.active[] | select(.status | test("DISCHARGED|Discharged")) | .id)' .dev/debt.yaml | grep -qx "$DROW" && echo discharged || echo open

# highest existing id → next free is +1. MUST scope to the `id:` field — a bare
# `grep -oE 'D-[0-9]+'` over the whole file also matches D-NNN in PROSE (cross-
# refs, and any typo'd phantom ref), so it can return a number with NO real row
# (e.g. a stray `D-NNNN` once made it return a too-high phantom when the true max was 363).
grep -oE 'id: "D-[0-9]+' .dev/debt.yaml | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | sort -n | tail -1
# yq equivalent (also id-scoped):
#   yq -r '.active[].id, .discharged[].id' .dev/debt.yaml | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | sort -n | tail -1
```

Note: `check_debt_id_refs.sh` does the phantom/undefined-id gate with
plain `rg` over the file (any `D-NNN` anywhere counts as "defined"), so
that check does NOT need yq — keep it grep-based. **Known blind spot**: a
typo'd reference that itself looks like a `D-NNN` (e.g. a stray `D-NNNN`)
appears in its own prose, so the "appears somewhere → defined" rule counts
it as defined and the gate does NOT flag it. The id-scoped next-id recipe
above is the robust cross-check (a phantom never has an `id:` row); to
audit for phantoms, diff the set of referenced ids against the set of
`id:`-defined ids:
`comm -23 <(grep -oE 'D-[0-9]+' .dev/debt.yaml | sort -u) <(grep -oE 'id: "D-[0-9]+' .dev/debt.yaml | grep -oE 'D-[0-9]+' | sort -u)`
prints any referenced-but-undefined id (empty = clean).

## Other SSOTs (same idioms)

- `compat_tiers.yaml` / `placement.yaml`: same single-quote + `strenv()`
  rules. `placement.yaml` automation lives in
  `scripts/check_placement_status.sh`; `feature_deps.yaml` in
  `scripts/check_provisional_sync.sh` + `audit_scaffolding/CHECKS.md`.
- `bench/history` schema (ADR-0044) is queried in
  `scripts/check_bench_regression.sh` — mirror the `strenv()` idiom there for
  any var-parameterised query.

## Scope (forward-looking — like `orphan_prevention.md` / `zig_tips.md`)

This is a **reference** rule: it guides *future* yq usage, it does not gate
or mandate a one-shot retrofit. Existing scripts that still use the fragile
string-splice form work today because their interpolated values are
controlled (no metachars): `scripts/check_bench_regression.sh:55,85`
(`'"$MACHINE_ID"'` / `'"$LOCK_ID"'` splices) and
`scripts/check_placement_status.sh:63,68` (`\"$status\"`). Harden these to
`strenv()` **opportunistically** when next touching those files — not as a
standalone churn. (The two `env(ID)` reads in
`scripts/check_accepted_divergences.sh:50,56` compare against an `id` token
with no `: `, so `env()` does not break there — but `strenv()` is the safer
form to adopt next time that file is touched.)
