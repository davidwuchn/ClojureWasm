# Gate cadence (batch additive, gate shared-code)

Auto-loaded when editing the test runner / hook scripts / settings.
Codifies *when* the full Mac gate (`bash test/run_all.sh`, ~50s) must
run, and makes the policy **mechanically enforced** rather than prose.

## Why

The full gate is ~50s. Empirically (2026-05-30 session retrospective),
on **additive coverage** — a new `.clj` def, a new primitive, a new
`Math` method, a new e2e — the full gate caught **0 regressions** that
the per-feature smoke (`zig build` + `cljw -e` probes + the single new
e2e, ~2s) had not already caught. Additive changes cannot break the
other ~144 tests, so the full gate there is near-pure insurance.

Where the gate **earns its ~50s** is **shared-code** changes: editing
an existing primitive / `promote.zig` / analyzer / `eval/` path / the
VM, or `build.zig*`. Those carry real regression risk and are the only
place the dual-backend diff oracle (TreeWalk↔VM parity) can catch a
divergence the smoke does not.

So: **batch additive, gate shared-code.**

## The policy

| Commit class        | Definition                                                                                         | Gate requirement                                                            |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Non-source**      | No `src/` / `test/` / `build.zig*` staged (docs, `.dev/`, `.claude/`, `scripts/`)                  | Exempt — never gated, never counted                                        |
| **Additive source** | Touches `src/` or `test/`, **pure insertion** (no existing line removed/modified), no `build.zig*` | May accumulate up to **5** commits since the last full gate; the 6th blocks |
| **Risky / shared**  | `build.zig*` staged, OR an existing `src/` or `test/` line removed/modified                        | **Fresh full gate every time**                                              |

"Fresh full gate" = `test/run_all.sh` ran to a full green (no `--only` /
`--skip`) on the exact state being committed.

## Mechanical enforcement (this is law, not advice)

- **`scripts/gate_state_hash.sh`** — prints a fingerprint by hashing the
  *content* (path + bytes) of every tracked or untracked-non-ignored file
  under `src/` + `test/` + `build.zig*` (`bench/` excluded). Hashing
  content — not a diff vs HEAD — makes the fingerprint independent of HEAD
  position and of staging, so it still matches after `git add` and survives
  a `git add && git commit` batched into one shell command.
- **`test/run_all.sh`** — on a full green gate (no `--only`/`--skip`) writes
  that fingerprint to `.dev/.gate_pass` AND clears the batch counter
  `.dev/.gate_cadence` to 0 (both gitignored): a full green gate validates
  everything up to now, so the additive batch restarts.
- **`scripts/check_gate_cadence.sh`** — PreToolUse hook on `git commit`.
  Classifies the change from **`git diff HEAD` + an untracked listing**
  (NOT `git diff --cached`): a PreToolUse hook fires *before* the command,
  so `git add … && git commit` batched into one call leaves the index empty
  at hook time — `--cached` would see nothing and wrongly exempt the commit.
  `git diff HEAD` reflects the working tree regardless of whether `git add`
  ran. Rule: any deleted line in a tracked `src/`/`test/` file ⇒ risky;
  `build.zig*` modified ⇒ risky; a new untracked `src/`/`test/` file or a
  pure insertion ⇒ additive. If the current fingerprint equals
  `.dev/.gate_pass`, the gate verified this exact content ⇒ authorise +
  reset the counter (`.dev/.gate_cadence`). Otherwise: risky ⇒ block;
  additive ⇒ consume a batch slot, block at the 6th.

`git commit --no-verify` is denied in `.claude/settings.json`, so the
hook cannot be bypassed. `GATE_MAX_BATCH` (default 5) is overridable
via env for a one-off.

**Clean-tree implication.** Because classification reads the whole working
tree vs HEAD (not just the index), a dirty *risky* `src/`/`test/` file
blocks **every** commit until it is gated, reverted, or committed — even a
doc-only commit. This is intentional: it enforces the edit → gate → commit
rhythm (one unit at a time, clean tree between units). Stage-and-commit a
unit before starting the next; don't leave a half-done risky edit lying
beside an unrelated commit.

## Workflow it produces

- Additive coverage sprint: edit → fast smoke (`zig build` + `cljw -e`
  + the new e2e) → commit. Up to 5 such commits ride without the full
  gate. Run `bash test/run_all.sh` on the 5th (or whenever convenient) —
  a full green gate clears the batch counter, so the next 5 additive
  commits ride again. (A subsequent commit whose exact content the gate
  verified is also authorised as "fresh" and zeroes the counter.)
- Shared-code change: edit → `bash test/run_all.sh` → commit (the gate
  stamped `.dev/.gate_pass` for this state, so the commit is authorised).

The fast per-feature smoke is still expected on **every** change — the
batching only defers the *full* gate, never the smoke.

## Forward-looking (framework_completion note)

Per `framework_completion.md`, a new hook must state its discovery
criterion + sweep. This hook is **forward-looking** (like
`orphan_prevention.md`): it constrains *future* commits' cadence and
retrofits no existing code, so there is no existing-site population to
sweep. The "discovery recipe" is the classifier in
`check_gate_cadence.sh` itself, applied per future commit.

## Stale-ness

Stale if: the full gate stops being ~50s (re-measure the additive vs
shared cost asymmetry); a new shared-risk surface appears that the
numstat-deleted heuristic misses (e.g. a config file that gates
behaviour); or the additive batch of 5 proves wrong in practice.
