# Textbook survey before implementation

Auto-loaded when editing Zig sources. Codifies how the `/continue`
per-task TDD loop's **Step 0 (Survey)** consults the reference
codebases without being pulled by their styles.

## Survey procedure (default brief for the survey subagent)

Step 0 of the TDD loop dispatches a **`general-purpose`** subagent
(NOT `Explore`). The deliverable is a written file at
`private/notes/<phase>-<task>-survey.md`, and the built-in `Explore`
agent is shipped without `Edit` / `Write` / `NotebookEdit` (it is
read-only by design — see Claude Code's subagent definitions). A
read-only agent forces the main agent to re-route the survey body
through its own context to persist the file, which wastes context
and breaks on auto-compaction.

Use `general-purpose` (which carries the full tool set) so the
subagent writes the survey note directly. Use this brief shape:

```
Survey how <CONCEPT> is implemented in:
  - ~/Documents/MyProducts/ClojureWasm  (v1)
  - ~/Documents/MyProducts/ClojureWasmFromScratch_v1_ref  (v1_ref)
  - ~/Documents/OSS/<relevant>          (upstream)

Return 200–400 lines:
  - Files & line ranges where the concept lives
  - Key data shapes (types, fields)
  - Idioms used (Zig 0.16 / Clojure / etc.)
  - Differences across the three sources, with one-line "why each
    chose this"
  - 2–3 places where ClojureWasm v2 should likely DIVERGE based on
    ROADMAP §2 (Inviolable principles): P3 core stays stable, P4 no
    ad-hoc patches, A2 new features via new files, A6 ≤ 1000 lines.

Do NOT copy code. Describe the design space.
```

The summary lands in `private/notes/<phase>-<task>-survey.md`.

## Anti-pull guardrails

A survey is a hazard: reading 89K LOC of v1 makes it tempting to
copy the patterns wholesale. To prevent this:

### Guard 1 — Cite ROADMAP principles before adopting a v1 idiom

For each idiom you import from v1, write one line:

> Adopting v1 `<idiom>` because ROADMAP P# / A# / §N.M aligns with it.

If you can't write that line, the idiom is folklore — re-derive from
ROADMAP first.

### Guard 2 — Always note one DIVERGENCE

Step 0's deliverable must include "where ClojureWasm v2 diverges from
all three textbooks". If it doesn't, the survey was too shallow or
the concept is mechanical (in which case Step 0 should have been
skipped — see below).

### Guard 3 — `pub var` is forbidden, even if v1 uses it

ROADMAP §13 lists patterns to reject regardless of textbook
precedent: `pub var` vtables, `std.Thread.Mutex`, `std.io.AnyWriter`,
JVM-class implementations. The survey may surface these; do not
adopt them.

### Guard 4 — Tier outsiders go to ADR or pod

If v1 has a `lib_X` integration that requires branching code in a
shared file, **do not replicate**. Either write a Tier-promotion
ADR (`.dev/decisions/NNNN_promote_X.md`) or implement as a Wasm
Component pod. ROADMAP §6.4 is non-negotiable.

## The survey is not immutable — Step 0.7 may amend it

Surveys are ~80% accurate at write time. The remaining ~20% surfaces
only once implementation begins (the prerequisite was missed; the
recommended shape is smallest-diff bias against the finished form;
a provisional behaviour will need to be introduced).

CLAUDE.md § Autonomous Workflow **Step 0.7 (Re-laying against
finished-form)** is the main-agent pass that catches this. After
Step 0 hands back the survey note, before Step 1's plan is
committed, the main agent:

- Walks the prerequisite chain to confirm what the survey assumed.
- Re-lays the recommended shape against the F-NNN envelope
  (`.dev/project_facts.md`) + `.dev/structure_plan.md` +
  ROADMAP §9.
- **Amends the survey in place** when reality drifts from the
  survey's prediction. Survey notes are not immutable contracts;
  they are the loop's working memory.
- Forks a Devil's-advocate subagent (mandatory, even at depth 1)
  when the re-laying surfaces a provisional behaviour, to
  enumerate finished-form-clean alternatives within the F-NNN
  envelope before committing to the provisional shape.

This is the discipline answer to "Step 0 is by a subagent and only
sees the snapshot; finished-form alignment is a main-agent
responsibility". The survey is the input; Step 0.7 is the
re-orientation against the project's invariants.

## When to skip Step 0

Skip only when **all** are true:

- The task is a refactor / rename / doc-only change.
- No new public API is introduced.
- Implementation does not change behaviour observable from outside the
  module.

If any of the above is false, do Step 0 even if "you already know how
v1 did it" — the survey output is the **input to the per-task note**
and the future chapter, not just for your present working memory.

## Where survey notes live

| File                                       | Purpose                                           | Tracked in git?   |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `private/notes/<phase>-<task>-survey.md`   | Step 0 raw output                                 | No (`.gitignore`) |
| `private/notes/<phase>-<task>.md`          | Step 7 per-task note (digests survey)             | No                |
| `docs/ja/learn_clojurewasm/NNNN_<slug>.md` | Chapter (digests notes)                           | Yes               |
| `.dev/decisions/NNNN_<slug>.md`            | ADR (load-bearing decisions surfaced from survey) | Yes               |

The flow is: **survey notes → per-task notes → chapter**. Not the
reverse, not skipping a step. Each layer is shorter than the last.
