# Handover framing discipline

Auto-loaded when editing `.dev/handover.md`. Codifies the cw v1
2026-05-23 retrospective + the matching zwasm v2 rule
(`~/Documents/MyProducts/zwasm_from_scratch/.claude/rules/handover_framing.md`).

Two failure modes have repeatedly bloated cw's handover:

1. **Log accumulation** — successive "Just landed — §X" sections
   pile up across sessions; the file becomes a session diary
   redundant with `git log`.
2. **Surrender framing** — phrases like
   "コンテキスト圧があるため一旦 idle に入る" /
   "キリがいい" / "自然な区切り" turn the resume entry point
   into a stop signal that the closed 2-condition list (CLAUDE.md
   § Autonomous Workflow) does not authorise.

## The rule

`.dev/handover.md` is a **driving document**, not a
**deliberation document** or **session log**. Every entry must
either:

1. Describe the concrete **next task** the resume should execute
   (§9.<N>.<M> identifier + retrievable file/section pointers), OR
2. Name a **provable external blocker** with a testable barrier
   condition (already a `debt.md` row by default — handover only
   names the row by ID).

Anything else is forbidden framing. The loop reads handover to
decide **what to do next**, not whether to do anything.

## Hard length limit: ≤ 100 lines

Above 100 lines, the framing has drifted into log / deliberation /
forecast. Trim before commit. `git log` and `.dev/ROADMAP.md`
already carry the history and the forecast.

## Forbidden patterns (grep-enforceable)

The following appearances anywhere in `.dev/handover.md` are
**block-level findings** that resume Step 1 (`/continue`) must
repair before proceeding.

### Phrase-level (surrender / stop-rationalisation framing)

|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| More than **one** `## Just landed` section                       | Log accumulation; `git log` is the SSOT                                                  | Keep at most the most-recent landing as a single ≤ 10-line section, or drop entirely once next task starts |
| `## Future ... shopping list` / forecast tables                  | Forecast belongs in `.dev/debt.md` (recall trigger row) or ROADMAP §A / ADR governance  | Move to debt.md as a `D-NNN` row with `Status: recall trigger` and remove from handover                     |
| `## Notes for the next session` reproducing rule / skill content | CLAUDE.md / `.claude/rules/` / skill `SKILL.md` are the SSOT — auto-loaded each session | Drop; the next session re-reads the source SSOT                                                             |
| Numeric predictions (`~N tasks remain`, cycle counts)            | Per `no_handover_predictions.md`                                                         | Concrete identifiers (`next: §9.6 / 4.4`); no counts                                                       |

## What handover IS for

- **Cold-start reading order** (≤ 3 files; the first is handover
  itself) so a fresh session reaches the active task in < 30 sec.
- **Current state** — phase number, branch, last commit, gate
  status (1-line summary; not a changelog).
- **Active task** — §9.<N>.<M> identifier + 1-2 sentence
  description + retrievable identifiers (ADR refs, file paths,
  test name).
- **Next phase queue** — only when the current phase is within a
  task or two of closing AND the next phase's entry items are not
  already in §9.<N+1> placeholder.
- **Open questions / blockers** — testable external dependencies
  only; otherwise the row belongs in `.dev/debt.md`.

## What handover IS NOT for

- Listing past landings (`git log --oneline` is the SSOT).
- Listing future ADRs / debts / refactors (debt.md and ROADMAP
  §A are the SSOTs).
- Re-explaining rules / skills / output styles (the SSOT files are
  auto-loaded each session).
- Multi-option pickup menus — pick the one option in handover
  itself.
- "Cycle 1 did X, cycle 2 did Y" running log (per-task notes in
  `private/notes/` are the SSOT and are gitignored).

## Reviewer checklist

When reviewing a handover.md commit:

- [ ] ≤ 100 lines total.
- [ ] No phrase from the forbidden-phrase table.
- [ ] At most **one** `## Just landed` section.
- [ ] No forecast / shopping-list table.
- [ ] `Active task` names a concrete next §9.<N>.<M> task, not
      an option list.
- [ ] `Open questions / blockers` rows are either testable
      external blockers OR already mirrored as `.dev/debt.md`
      D-NNN rows (named here by ID).
- [ ] No numeric predictions (per
      [`no_handover_predictions.md`](no_handover_predictions.md)).

## How `/continue` enforces this

The resume procedure (Step 1) scans handover for length + forbidden
phrases:

```sh
wc -l .dev/handover.md   # warn if > 100
grep -nE 'コンテキスト圧があるため|キリがいい|自然な区切り|natural break|good stopping point|この辺で一旦停止|Phase boundary reached AND|If above ~60%|context budget|/compact|user 確認待ち|awaiting user confirmation|awaiting approval|cannot be self-decided|human judgement|human judgment|needs human|user touchpoint|help wanted|awaiting human review|defer to user|ADR-level decision' .dev/handover.md
grep -c '^## Just landed' .dev/handover.md   # warn if > 1
grep -nE '^## Future .* shopping list|^## Notes for the next session' .dev/handover.md
```

On any hit → the FIRST task of the resume is the handover rewrite
itself, not the prose-suggested next task. Then the loop proceeds
normally.

This is by design: the framing fix is cheap (~5 minutes) and
catastrophic to skip — a single forbidden section can cost a
session of mis-anchored work.

## Legitimate stop framing

The closed stop list (CLAUDE.md § Autonomous Workflow) has only
two conditions:

1. User explicitly requests stop.
2. Physical block — unrecoverable build / test failure.

Both produce a concrete handover entry. For condition 1, name the
user instruction verbatim (or paraphrase) so the resume reads
back what was asked. For condition 2, name the failing test /
build artifact and the diagnosis attempted:

```markdown
## Stopped — user requested

User instruction (2026-MM-DD): "<verbatim or close paraphrase>".
Resume at §9.<N>.<M> after the user signals continuation.
```

```markdown
## Stopped — physical block

`bash test/run_all.sh` fails at `<test_name>` on `<host>`.
Diagnosed: <one sentence on what was tried and what is unknown>.
Resume needs <named external fix>.
```

ADR-level design choices are **not** a stop condition. They are
handled inline per CLAUDE.md (the AI drafts and accepts the ADR
itself, lands the doc commit, then proceeds with the source).
Handover entries that frame an ADR-level choice as a stop are a
block-level finding — rewrite as an Active task entry that names
the design choice and the candidate ADR slug.

## Stale-ness

This rule is stale if:

- The forbidden-phrase table no longer matches actual handover
  drift. Re-derive from
  `git log -p .dev/handover.md --since="90 days ago"` and surface
  new euphemisms.
- The closed 2-condition stop list in CLAUDE.md § Autonomous
  Workflow changes; the "Legitimate stop framing" section above
  must mirror the canonical wording.
