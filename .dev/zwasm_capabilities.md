# zwasm capability ledger — cljw's view of the embedded Wasm runtime (F-001)

> **SSOT for "what does the zwasm we embed offer, and what has cljw adopted".**
> cljw embeds **zwasm v2** (F-001, unavoidable) as a SHA-pinned dependency. zwasm
> is itself under active co-development (`~/Documents/MyProducts/zwasm_from_scratch`,
> branch `zwasm-from-scratch`) and its embedding API is *growing* — notably toward
> a **JIT-backed engine** (the cljw north star, ROADMAP §9.0 gap area II × III).

## The read-at-boundaries convention (why this file exists)

The cljw loop **cannot infer zwasm's status from its own tree** — the pin is frozen
at one commit while zwasm moves on. So, at every **gap-area-unit start** (CLAUDE.md
Step 1a) **and every Phase boundary**, the loop MUST:

1. Read THIS file (cljw's recorded view + adoption status).
2. Refresh it against zwasm's **live** status sources (below). If zwasm shipped a
   capability cljw's north star needs, update the table here + decide adoption.
3. Treat a capability as **adoptable only when zwasm marks it ready AND cljw bumps
   the pin** (`build.zig.zon`) — never adopt against an unpinned/moving API.

This is the cljw-side, git-tracked face of the **dogfooding handover protocol**
(simplified, no-loop, 2-state — `dogfooding_handover/PROTOCOL.md` below). **Also at
each unit boundary (after a commit, before the next Step 0), check the INBOX**
(`to_cljw_*.md` with `Status: SENT`); handle it, then flip to `CONSUMED`. When cljw
needs a not-yet-ready zwasm capability, the request goes out as a `from_cljw_NN.md`
(finished-form, request-don't-workaround; mark the dependent cljw task PENDING), never
a cljw-side shim.

| Source                                                                   | What it tells you                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `~/Documents/MyProducts/zwasm_from_scratch/private/dogfooding_handover/` | **the mailbox** — `PROTOCOL.md` + `from_cljw_NN`/`to_cljw_NN` |
| `~/Documents/MyProducts/zwasm_from_scratch/.dev/ROADMAP.md`              | zwasm phase plan (p17 = JIT)                                   |

## Pin

- **RELATIVE-PATH EXPERIMENT mode (user-directed 2026-06-21).** `build.zig.zon`
  `.zwasm` is now `.path = "../zwasm_from_scratch"` (was the SHA pin
  `412966f7…`). The JIT readiness signal arrived (`to_cljw_02`, embedder-stable
  @ `9fcf9fb5b`+), so the JIT adoption unit is live; the user directed consuming
  zwasm's live tree by relative path to experiment with JIT/SIMD reproducibly
  **locally**. A `.path` dep is NOT reproducible for others, so cljw commits
  **accumulate un-pushed** until the experiment settles and zwasm cuts a
  pinnable SHA/tag — then this reverts to the SHA-pin form (the URL+hash live in
  git history / the `build.zig.zon` comment).
- `lazy` dependency: the default build + gate never resolve it; only `-Dwasm` /
  `-Dzwasm-spike` do. So a churning dep never breaks the day-to-day gate — it
  only gates what `cljw.wasm/*` can do. (Caveat in this mode: the wasm e2e steps
  now require the sibling `../zwasm_from_scratch` tree again, so they won't run on
  ubuntunote until the pin is restored — acceptable while un-pushed.)
- Pin-bump (back to SHA): zwasm `docs/consuming_prerelease_zwasm.md`. Re-pin is
  **user-gated** (a moving north-star API; the loop proposes, the user confirms).

## Capability table (refresh at each boundary)

| Capability                           | zwasm status (as of 2026-06-21)                          | in cljw's tree? | cljw adoption                                  | ref            |

| `invoke` (call exported fn)          | ready (interp + JIT)                                     | YES (rel-path)  | integrated; JIT `invoke` verified via unit test | D-036, D-488   |
| Embedder hardening / WASI sandbox    | landed (security pass `…→6b08fe70`, 3-host green)      | mostly          | consumed (old security mailbox)                | CODEV          |
| **Multi-arg JIT invoke (≤5/7 GPR)** | **ready** (embedder-stable, to_cljw_02 matrix)           | YES (rel-path)  | exercised by the dual-engine unit test         | to_cljw_02     |
| **SIMD (v128) body on JIT**          | **ready** (JIT-only by design; interp has no v128 dispatch) | YES (rel-path) | verified (lane0→42 on .jit); interp traps catchably | D-488      |
| `exportFuncSig` on JIT instance      | **ready** (JIT arm shipped @5b6449779, to_cljw_03)       | YES (rel-path)  | adopted — explicit `:jit` `wasm/call` works end-to-end (e2e) | D-488 |
| **JIT-backed engine (`.auto`)**      | **REVERTED to interp** (@1e01e6797; C-surface incomplete, zwasm D-478) | YES (rel-path) | default pinned `.interp` (zwasm-endorsed); `:jit` explicit works | D-488 |
| WIT component marshalling            | future                                                   | NO              | NOT adopted                                    | D-404          |

## Forward plan — the JIT adoption unit (gap area II × III)

The north-star capability is **running Wasm components through zwasm's JIT engine**
from cljw. The trigger + shape:

1. **Trigger**: zwasm cuts a commit/tag where ADR-0200's JIT engine + zwasm#477 invoke
   are *embedder-stable* (a `to_cljw_NN.md` with the pin SHA announces it; from_cljw_01 sent 2026-06-20).
2. **cljw action**: bump the `build.zig.zon` pin (user-confirmed) → open a gap-area-II
   adoption unit: thread an `:engine :jit` (or auto) option through the finished-form
   `(wasm/load path opts)` surface (D-350), keep interp as the fallback/default until
   JIT is proven, add a diff-oracle/e2e that runs the SAME module both engines and
   asserts equal results (the F-012 discipline applied to engine choice).
3. **Do NOT** speculatively build a JIT facade in cljw before zwasm's API stabilises
   (the CODEV stance: request-don't-workaround; F-002 finished-form, not a shim).

D-036 is the master integration row; D-350 the embedding-API shape; this ledger is
the capability tracker that tells the loop *when* the JIT row flips from BUILDING to
adoptable.

## Revision log

- **2026-06-20** — ledger created (user-directed convention). Pin = pre-JIT
  `412966f7`. zwasm JIT (ADR-0200 / zwasm#477) recorded as BUILDING, not yet adoptable.
- **2026-06-20** — handover protocol simplified (user-directed): no-loop, 2-state
  (`SENT`/`CONSUMED`), mailbox moved to `zwasm_from_scratch/private/dogfooding_handover/`.
  Sent `from_cljw_01.md` — JIT embedding-API consuming requirements (per-instance engine
  selection + interp stays, for cljw's dual-engine diff oracle) + a readiness-signal
  request (a future `to_cljw_NN` naming the pin SHA when embedder-stable).
- **2026-06-21** — JIT adoption unit OPENED (user-directed relative-path experiment, no-push).
  Consumed `to_cljw_02` (readiness signal): switched `build.zig.zon` `.zwasm` to
  `.path = "../zwasm_from_scratch"`; threaded `{:engine :jit/:interp/:auto}` through
  engine.zig + surface.zig; landed a dual-engine unit test (GPR jit==interp; SIMD-on-jit
  → 42). Found `exportFuncSig` returned null on JIT instances → blocked `wasm/call` on
  `:jit`; sent `from_cljw_02`. Same-session co-dev: zwasm shipped the exportFuncSig JIT
  arm @5b6449779 + REVERTED its `.auto`→JIT flip (@1e01e6797, C-surface incomplete) →
  `to_cljw_03`. Rebuilt on `5b6449779`: explicit `:jit` `wasm/call` now works end-to-end;
  landed the surface e2e `phase16_wasm_engine_select.sh`. cljw default stays `.interp`
  (zwasm-endorsed) until zwasm re-lands `.auto`→JIT (their D-478); tracked as cljw D-488.
  SIMD confirmed JIT-only by zwasm design (dual-engine oracle scoped to scalar bodies).
