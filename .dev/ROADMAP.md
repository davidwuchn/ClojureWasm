# ClojureWasm — ROADMAP

> **Status of this document**
>
> The single authoritative plan for this project. It collapses the mission,
> principles, architecture, scope, phase plan, quality bar, and future
> decision points onto one page. The standard Claude Code rule applies:
> if anything elsewhere disagrees with this file, this file wins.
>
> Detailed implementation discussions presuppose this document. Anything
> that contradicts it must go through an ADR (`.dev/decisions/`); ad-hoc
> deviations are not allowed.
>
> History lives in git — see `git log -- .dev/ROADMAP.md` for diffs,
> `docs/ja/learn_clojurewasm/NNNN_*.md` for the story behind each change, and
> `.dev/decisions/` for load-bearing decisions.

## 0. How to read this file

A cold-context AI (or new contributor) starting from `/continue`
hits this stack in order:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** (every-turn auto-load) — `§ Autonomous Workflow`
   Step 0-8 loop + Stop ONLY / Do NOT stop / When in doubt continue.
2. **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** (5-minute orientation) — zones / backends /
   error / tier / phase map. Pointers to all the documents below.
3. **`.dev/principle.md`** — working principles + Bad Smell
   catalogue + four depths of revision. Re-read at Step 1 / 4 / 6.
4. **`.dev/handover.md`** — current state, Active task, Next Phase
   Queue. The `SessionStart` hook auto-prints the Current state +
   Active task sections.
5. **This file (`.dev/ROADMAP.md`)** — authoritative plan, with
   §15.0 listing all entry points if you need to scan further.
6. **`.dev/decisions/NNNN_*.md`** — 25 ADRs (browse on demand,
   §15.1 ADR category index).

The autonomous TDD loop runs entirely from this stack — there are
no other "must-read" documents. Phase open procedure is in
CLAUDE.md `§ Autonomous Workflow`; ROADMAP placeholders for
Phase 5-20 (§9.7-§9.22) are the targets the procedure expands.

## 1. Mission and differentiation

### 1.1 Mission

**A Clojure runtime that does not depend on the JVM, with first-class edge
and Wasm support, implemented in Zig 0.16.0.**

- **No JVM**: target binary ≤ 5 MB, cold start ≤ 10 ms
- **Edge execution**: runs on Cloudflare Workers / Fastly / Fermyon Spin
  and other Wasm Component Model hosts
- **Language semantics compatible**: preserve Clojure JVM's *observable*
  behaviour. The Java interop surface (`.method`, `Class/`) is mapped onto
  v2's internal `Class` concept, not Java itself.
- **Teachable**: shrink code volume to 30–40 % of v1 (89K LOC) and document
  the design decision behind every phase.

### 1.2 Differentiation (3 axes)

| # | Axis                       | Edge over the field                                                                                    |
|---|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Edge-native Clojure**    | Babashka is native but produces no Wasm. SCI is JS-only. v2 makes Wasm Component a first-class output. |
| 2 | **Wasm-native interop**    | `require` a Wasm module as a Clojure ns. Inversely, expose Clojure functions as WIT exports.           |
| 3 | **Comprehensible runtime** | Codebase is small enough to be read end-to-end. Each phase ships a written walkthrough.                |

### 1.3 Intended users

- **Clojurians shipping to edge / serverless** who find Babashka / SCI
  short on concurrency or Wasm interop.
- **Wasm-ecosystem users** who want to call a Clojure runtime as a
  component, or distribute a Clojure DSL as a Wasm component.
- **Learners of runtime implementation** who want design decisions and
  implementation in lockstep.

### 1.4 Versioning and release commitment

v0.1.0 is the first stable release. SemVer applies from v0.1.0 onward.
Pre-v0.1.0 phases (1-20 in §9) are internal development; ROADMAP and
ADR amendments may break behaviour. After v0.1.0:

- **MAJOR**: Tier A / B namespace removal, special-form removal,
  binary-format change (e.g., `cljw build` output).
- **MINOR**: Tier C / D shift, new namespace, new special form, new
  builtin.
- **PATCH**: bug fix only, no behaviour change.

Tier D is permanent (per ADR-0013): vars and packages listed there
will not be added in any MINOR / PATCH release. Adding a Tier D
entry requires a MAJOR release and an amendment to ADR-0013.

The v0.1.0 deliverable specification (which subset of Tier A is the
minimum success criterion) is finalized in Phase 11+; the SemVer
rule above holds independently of that decision.

## 2. Inviolable principles

These do not change between phases. Changing one requires an ADR.

| #   | Principle                                 | Effect                                                                                              |
|-----|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P1  | **Move forward only with understanding**  | Interactive Claude Code use. No overnight batch commits.                                            |
| P2  | **See the final shape on day 1**          | Final directory layout fixed in §5. Adding a file ≠ adding a feature.                             |
| P3  | **Core stays stable**                     | The core, once built, stops changing. Extensions go to `modules/` or pods.                          |
| P4  | **No ad-hoc patches**                     | Solve structurally. Ad-hoc fixes are escalated to ADRs or rejected.                                 |
| P5  | **Modular by build**                      | Only the bytes you need land in the binary (modules + comptime flags + pods).                       |
| P6  | **Error quality is non-negotiable**       | From day 1: file/ns/line/col/source-context/colour/stack trace.                                     |
| P7  | **Upstream fidelity is not a constraint** | Practicality first. Compatibility differences are documented via tiers.                             |
| P8  | **One `cljw` binary**                     | Single binary serves REPL / nREPL / eval / build / wasm-component-out.                              |
| P9  | **One commit = one task**                 | Structural change and behavioural change live in separate commits. Never commit when tests are red. |
| P10 | **Honour Zig 0.16 idioms**                | `std.Io` DI, `*std.Io.Writer`, packed struct, comptime, `@branchHint`, etc.                         |
| P11 | **Observable-semantics compatibility**    | Match what callers can observe; the inside of `.toString` is ours to choose.                        |
| P12 | **Dual backend from Phase 4 onward**      | TreeWalk and VM agree on every test, verified by `--compare` (CI mandatory; ADR-0005, ADR-0022).    |

### 2.1 Architecture principles (verifiable)

The principles split into two tables. **§2.1.a** is the original cw v0
inheritance — structural invariants verified by a gate. **§2.1.b** is
the Phase 4 entry batch — ADR-backed extensions, each row pointing at
its source ADR.

#### §2.1.a — Structural invariants (cw v0 inheritance, gate-verified)

| #  | Principle                                                       | Verified by                                                                   |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A1 | Lower zones do not import upper zones                           | `scripts/zone_check.sh --gate` (CI)                                           |
| A2 | New features go via new files, not edits to existing ones       | ModuleDef + comptime flags + pods                                             |
| A3 | Optimisation code lives in a dedicated subtree                  | `src/eval/optimize/` only                                                     |
| A4 | GC is an isolated subsystem                                     | `runtime/gc/{arena, mark_sweep, roots}.zig`                                   |
| A5 | Tests mirror the source layout                                  | `test/` mirrors `src/`                                                        |
| A6 | One file ≤ 1,000 lines (soft limit)                            | Avoids the cw v0 `collections.zig` (6K LOC) trap; hard cap 2,000 per ADR-0016 |
| A7 | Concurrency and errors are designed in on day 1                 | Runtime handle + threadlocal binding + SourceLocation                         |
| A8 | Interop is a single deep module                                 | `lang/interop.zig` routes through `TypeDescriptor` per ADR-0007 (Option β)   |
| A9 | External modules go through a single `ExternalModule` interface | comptime / .clj source / wasm pod loaded uniformly                            |

#### §2.1.b — Phase 4 entry batch (ADR-backed extensions)

| #   | Principle                                                   | ADR source                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## 3. Scope: what we build, what we do not

### 3.1 In scope (will be implemented as Tier A or B)

- The bulk of `clojure.core` (~700 vars)
- `clojure.string`, `clojure.set`, `clojure.walk`, `clojure.zip`, `clojure.edn`
- `clojure.test` (deftest, is, are)
- `clojure.pprint` (basic)
- `clojure.spec.alpha` (core operators; `fdef`/`instrument` start at Tier C)
- `clojure.tools.cli`
- `clojure.java.io` equivalent (Zig-native I/O backing, same names)
- `clojure.java.shell` equivalent
- `clojure.data.json`
- Concurrency primitives: atom / agent / future / promise / delay / volatile / dynamic var
- Persistent collections: PersistentList / Vector (32-way trie + tail) / HashMap (HAMT) / HashSet
- Lazy seq + chunked seq + transducers (with fused reduce)
- Protocol / Multimethod / Record (Tier A)
- ExceptionInfo / try / catch / throw / finally
- Reader macros: `'`, `` ` ``, `~`, `~@`, `^`, `#()`, `#'`, `#"re"`, `#inst`, `#uuid`
- nREPL (CIDER-compatible, 14 ops)
- `deps.edn` resolution (basic)
- Wasm Component pod loading
- CLI (`cljw eval / repl / nrepl / build / component`)

### 3.2 Out of scope permanently (Tier D)

Authoritative list lives in `compat_tiers.yaml` `tiers.D.excluded_*`
(per ADR-0013). Summary at the ROADMAP level:

**Excluded special forms (5)**:

- `gen-class` — requires JVM Class system and bytecode emission.
- `gen-interface` — same.
- `clojure.core/compile` — JVM .class emission.
- `proxy` when targeting deep Java extension (Apache HC base classes,
  Swing GUI base classes, `java.util.logging.Formatter / Handler`).
  Other `proxy` uses go through `reify` against cw-native protocols.
- `bean`'s reflection-deep variant. Basic field walk via
  `TypeDescriptor` stays Tier C.

**Excluded Java packages**:

- `java.awt.*`, `javax.swing.*`, `java.applet.*` (GUI, out of scope).
- Deep reflection internals beyond what `TypeDescriptor` exposes.

**Other**:

- AOT compilation (lein-aot equivalent).
- Dynamic Wasm generation in-runtime (security and complexity; Pod
  boundary covers the legitimate uses per ADR-0006).

**Forms moved OUT of Tier D since the original ROADMAP**:

- `reify`, `definterface`, `class?`, `supers`, `bases`, `bean` (basic),
  `(.method obj)`, `import`, `new`, `set!`, `doto`, `..` — now Tier A
  via `TypeDescriptor` (ADR-0007) and unified `.method` dispatch
  (ADR-0008).
- `monitor-enter`, `monitor-exit`, `locking` — now Tier A on heap
  values only (ADR-0009).
- STM (`ref`, `dosync`, `alter`, `commute`, `ensure`, `ref-set`) — now
  Tier A with full MVCC (ADR-0010); Phase 13-15 implementation.

### 3.3 Deferred (re-evaluate later)

- ClojureScript → JS compiler (v0.2.0 or later)
- RRB-Tree vector (only when vector slicing performance demands it)
- Generational GC (only after mark-sweep is stable)
- ARM64 / x86_64 JIT (gated by Phase 17 outcome)
- WasmGC backend (current line: linear memory + NaN boxing)

## 4. Architecture

### 4.1 Four-zone layered (absolute dependency direction)

```
Layer 3: src/app/         CLI, REPL, nREPL, deps, builder
                          ↓ may import anything below
Layer 2: src/lang/        Primitives, Interop, Bootstrap, NS Loader
                          ↓ imports runtime/ + eval/
Layer 1: src/eval/        Reader, Analyzer, Compiler, VM, TreeWalk
                          ↓ imports runtime/ only
Layer 0: src/runtime/     Value, Collections, GC, Env, Dispatch, Module
                          ↑ imports nothing above

modules/                  comptime-gated optional (math, c-ffi, wasm)
                          imports runtime/ + eval/ only
```

When a lower zone needs to call an upper zone: vtable pattern. The lower
zone declares the `VTable` type, the upper zone injects function pointers
at startup. `scripts/zone_check.sh --gate` blocks any violation in CI.

### 4.2 NaN-boxed Value representation

All values fit in `u64` (8 bytes).

| `0xFFFC` Group A | heap (8 subtypes) | string / symbol / keyword / list / vector / array_map / hash_map / hash_set                              |
| `0xFFFD` Group B | heap              | fn_val / multi_fn / protocol / protocol_fn / var_ref / ns / delay / regex                                |
| `0xFFFE` Group C | heap              | lazy_seq / cons / chunked_cons / chunk_buffer / atom / agent / `ref(*)` / volatile                       |
| `0xFFFF` Group D | heap              | transient_vector / transient_map / transient_set / reduced / ex_info / wasm_module / wasm_fn / **class** |

(*) The `ref` slot is reserved but STM is not implemented.

Heap addresses assume 8-byte alignment, shifted right by 3 bits → fits in
48 bits.

**1:1 slot mapping** (avoiding v1's slot-sharing + discriminant): type
checks reduce to a bit comparison.

`HeapHeader` (`extern struct`):

```zig
pub const HeapHeader = extern struct {
    tag: HeapTag,    // u8
    flags: packed struct(u8) {
        marked: bool,
        frozen: bool,
        _pad: u6,
    },
};
```

### 4.3 Runtime handle + std.Io DI

**`Runtime` is a process-wide singleton**:

```zig
pub const Runtime = struct {
    io: std.Io,                  // 0.16 IO hub
    gpa: std.mem.Allocator,      // infrastructure allocator
    keywords: KeywordInterner,   // owns its mutex
    symbols: SymbolInterner,     // Phase 3+
    gc: ?*MarkSweepGc,           // Phase 5+
    interop: InterOp,            // Phase 9
    vtable: VTable,              // backend dispatch
};
```

**`VTable` is a struct (not `pub var`)** so tests can build a mock and
inject it.

**`std.Io` is DI'd through every layer** — no global variables.
`std.Io.Mutex.lock(io)` works because the caller has `rt.io` already.

**`threadlocal` is reserved for Clojure dynamic vars (`*ns*`, `*err*`,
binding frames) only**: `pub threadlocal var current_frame: ?*BindingFrame`.

### 4.4 Dual backend (TreeWalk + VM)

- **TreeWalk** (`eval/backend/tree_walk.zig`): reference implementation,
  exists from Phase 2. Simple, easy to debug.
- **VM** (`eval/backend/vm.zig`): stack machine, ~75 opcodes. From Phase 4.
- **Evaluator.compare()** (Phase 8+): runs the same expression in both and
  asserts equal results. Critical for catching silent bugs.

CLI: `cljw eval --tree-walk` switches backends; default is VM after Phase 4.

### 4.5 Interop as a single deep module + TypeDescriptor (Option β)

cw v1 adopts **Option β** (ADR-0007): a Zig-native `TypeDescriptor`
plays the role JVM's `Class` plays for Clojure, without inheriting
JVM bytecode emission or the runtime reflection surface. `Class`-like
behaviour (`class` / `instance?` / `type` / `deftype` / `defrecord`
/ `reify` / `definterface`) routes through this descriptor.

**TypeDescriptor** (per ADR-0007) holds:
- `fqcn` (interned symbol), `kind` (`native | deftype | defrecord
  | reify_anon`)
- `field_layout` (optional, fixed at analyzer time)
- `protocol_impls`, `method_table` (sorted slice + per-call-site
  `CallSite` cache from Phase 7, per ADR-0008)
- `parent` (optional), `meta`

`(.method obj args)` and `(ClassName. ...)` and `import` / `doto`
/ `..` all dispatch through `method_table.lookup` per ADR-0008.
Host-imported types (UUID / Date / File / …) register a
`TypeDescriptor` from `src/runtime/host/` per ADR-0011; from the
user's perspective the dispatch is identical to cw-native types.

The Phase-4 skeletons for these structs land in tasks 4.17 / 4.18
/ 4.25; full behaviours activate in Phase 5 (deftype / defrecord
/ reify) and Phase 7 (protocol dispatch with `CallSite` cache).

### 4.6 ExternalModule (one interface, three adapters)

```zig
pub const ExternalModule = struct {
    name: []const u8,
    load: *const fn(rt: *Runtime, env: *Env) anyerror!*Namespace,
    kind: enum { comptime_zig, clj_source, wasm_component_pod },
};
```

`(require '[my-lib :as l])` resolves through this single interface.

- **comptime_zig**: `modules/<name>/module.zig` (enabled by build flag)
- **clj_source**: `lang/clj/<name>.clj` via `@embedFile` + eval
- **wasm_component_pod**: `(require '[my-pod :as p :pod "my.wasm"])`
  loads a Wasm Component

### 4.7 GC subsystem

Phase 1: arena GC (bulk free).
End of Phase 5: mark-sweep GC + free-pool recycling.

```
src/runtime/gc/
├── arena.zig         Arena GC (Phase 1)
├── mark_sweep.zig    Mark-sweep + free pool (Phase 5)
└── roots.zig         Root set definition + per-type mark walk
```

- Mark bit lives in `ObjectHeader.gc_and_lock` low-30-bit range
  (per ADR-0009 / ADR-0017): `u32 gc_and_lock` packed as
  `lock_state: u2` at bits 0-1 and `gc_mark: u30` at bits 2-31.
- `suppress_count: u32` blocks collection during macro expansion.
- `--gc-stress` runs collect on every allocation (test only).
- `gc.collect(rt)` takes `*Runtime` and uses `std.Thread.Mutex`
  (Zig 0.16's primitive; cf. JVM_TO_ZIG.md §3.3 / §8.2).
- Allocator vtable callbacks do NOT take the mutex (per-thread
  arena or lock-free bump).
- Stop-the-world is acceptable at cw v1 scale (batch / REPL); the
  Phase 15+ re-evaluation considers generational GC if pause time
  becomes a problem (per ADR-0017 Consequences).

### 4.8 Memory tiers (3 allocators) — per ADR-0017

| Tier                      | Contents                                             | GC? | Lifetime                                    |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----|---------------------------------------------|
| GeneralPurposeAllocator   | Env, Namespace, Var, HashMap backing                 | No  | Process                                     |
| ArenaAllocator (per-eval) | Reader Form, Analyzer Node, short-lived seq pipeline | No  | Per-eval (bulk freed at REPL prompt return) |
| GcHeap (mark-sweep)       | Runtime Values reachable beyond one eval             | Yes | Mark-sweep                                  |

Nodes are not Values, so the GC will not trace them — false-liveness
is structurally avoided. Per-eval arena absorbs the majority of
short-lived allocation; the mark-sweep heap holds only objects that
outlive a single evaluation. See ADR-0017 for the rationale against
generational GC at Phase 5 scale.

## 5. Directory layout (final form)

Per **P2 (see the final shape on day 1)**, the full directory tree at the
end of all phases is fixed below. Phase 1 stubs out the directories; later
phases fill the contents without adding new directories.

## 6. Ecosystem compatibility: tier system

### 6.0 Tier data source (authoritative)

Tier classification is data-driven. The authoritative data lives in
`compat_tiers.yaml` at the repository root. The narrative in §6.1-§6.4
documents the framework; the YAML carries the per-var / per-class
classification.

`compat_tiers.yaml` is read by:

- the test runner (`test/clj/` for the Tier A 100% PASS gate),
- the catalog's per-form `tier_d_<form>` Codes (per ADR-0018
  amendment 2) — each Tier D form has its own Code with a
  hand-written user-facing template,
- the future `cljw --list-vars` command.

Amendment process:

1. Edit the YAML entry.
2. Open or amend the rationale ADR (typically ADR-0013 for Tier D).
3. If a Tier D promotion is involved, that is a MAJOR release per
   §1.4.
4. Reference the ADR in the commit message.

### 6.1 Tier definitions

| Tier  | Meaning                                                                          | Test requirement                                |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | Full semantic compatibility. Upstream tests pass as-is (or with cosmetic edits). | Upstream-ported tests **must be green**.        |
| **B** | Same names and shapes; v2-native implementation. Observable behaviour matches.   | Upstream-ported tests + `;; CLJW:` annotations. |
| **C** | Best-effort with documented gaps.                                                | Limited subset only; gaps noted.                |
| **D** | Not provided. Throws `UnsupportedException`.                                     | Only the throw-message test.                    |

### 6.2 Initial tier per namespace

`compat_tiers.yaml` (repo root) is the source of truth:

```yaml
clojure.core:        A   # complete by Phase 14
clojure.string:      A
clojure.set:         A
clojure.walk:        A
clojure.zip:         A
clojure.edn:         A
clojure.test:        A   # Phase 11
clojure.pprint:      B   # cosmetic differences allowed
clojure.spec.alpha:  B   # core operators only; fdef/instrument start at C
clojure.core.async:  C   # go macro becomes a thread fallback (same as Babashka)
clojure.tools.cli:   A
clojure.java.io:     B   # same names, Zig-native I/O backing
clojure.java.shell:  B
clojure.data.json:   A
java.lang.String:    D   # use Clojure string instead
java.util.Date:      B   # provided via #inst
java.io.File:        B   # via clojure.java.io
java.util.UUID:      B
java.util.regex:     A   # Tier-A-compatible custom regex engine
```

Third-party libraries live in the same yaml. Adding one requires an ADR
(see §6.3).

### 6.3 Tier-promotion / -demotion ADR rule

- **Stay at A**: upstream parity is observable, removal would hit multiple callers.
- **A → B (demotion)**: a behaviour is JVM-specific and the test needs annotation.
- **C → B (promotion)**: gap is closed. ADR with evidence.
- **D → C (promotion)**: at least one caller (test) works. ADR + partial implementation.

Each tier change is one ADR (`.dev/decisions/NNNN_promote_X.md`) recording
reason / tests / impact.

### 6.4 Ad-hoc workarounds are forbidden

**Do not write a branch in existing `.clj`/`.zig` to make a Tier-D library
work.** Instead:

1. Write an ADR to add it to the tier table (= official commitment), or
2. Implement it as a Wasm Component pod (= outside the runtime).

This prevents `if cljw then ...` branches from sprawling. Physical fence
against ad-hoc rot.

## 7. Concurrency design

### 7.1 Clojure reference-types ↔ Zig 0.16 primitive mapping

| Clojure prim   | Zig 0.16 mechanism                                                                                   | File                                     | Phase                    |

| **future**     | `std.Thread.spawn` + `Condition`                                                                     | `runtime/future.zig`                     | 15                       |

| **delay**      | `std.Thread.Mutex` (single lock + state machine)                                                     | `runtime/delay.zig`                      | 6                        |

| **binding**    | `threadlocal var dval_top: ?*DvalFrame`                                                              | `runtime/binding_stack.zig`              | 2 (task 4.22)            |
| **locking**    | Object header `lock_state` bits + `std.Thread.Mutex` (heavy lock table), heap values only (ADR-0009) | `runtime/lock.zig`                       | 5 (slot) / 15 (activate) |
| **core.async** | userspace coroutine on `std.Thread` pool (no built-in async in 0.16)                                 | `runtime/async.zig`                      | 15 stretch               |

### 7.2 STM is implemented (was: No STM)

`ref` / `dosync` / `alter` / `commute` / `ensure` / `ref-set` are
implemented as Tier A per ADR-0010. The cw v1 charter explicitly aims
beyond Babashka's subset; STM is the signature Clojure concurrency
primitive and is included.

The implementation matches JVM `LockingTransaction.java` semantics:
MVCC with TVal ring history per ref, thread-local transaction context,
retry loop with snapshot validation, ordered locking by ref pointer
(deadlock-free), and a barge mechanism (Phase 15.3) for starvation
control.

Phase staging:

- Phase 4 entry: data structures declared; any `dosync` returns a
  structured error referencing ADR-0010 (no-op stub forbidden per
  `no_op_stub_forbidden.md`).
- Phase 13: `Ref` and `TVal` data structures.
- Phase 14: `doGet` / `doSet` / `doCommute` / `doEnsure`.
- Phase 15.1: commit + retry loop.
- Phase 15.2: commute fast path.
- Phase 15.3: barge mechanism.
- Phase 15.4: concurrent integration test.

### 7.3 Dynamic vars stay on threadlocal

`*ns*`, `*err*`, `*print-length*` and friends are implemented with
threadlocal binding frames. This is a Clojure-semantics requirement, not
incidental — abolishing threadlocal is not an option.

### 7.4 Backend selection

- Development / tests / default: `std.Io.Threaded` (most stable).
- Production (Linux): re-evaluate `std.Io.Evented` (io_uring) at the end of
  Phase 15 (currently experimental).
- Production (darwin): re-evaluate `std.Io.Evented` (kqueue / GCD) likewise.
- `wasm32-wasi`: dedicated backend after WASI 0.3 stabilises.

`build.zig` accepts `-Dio-backend=threaded|uring|kqueue|wasi` as a
comptime gate.

---

## 8. Wasm / edge strategy

### 8.1 Adopted: hybrid

**Two artifacts from one source tree**:
1. **Native CLI** (`cljw`): the usual binary for macOS / Linux x86_64 / aarch64.
2. **Wasm Component** (`cljw.wasm`): Component-Model conformant; exports
   `clojure.eval` and friends via WIT.

The `Runtime` struct does not depend on the backend, so both fall out of
the same `std.Io` abstraction.

### 8.2 Pod system as Wasm Component

- WIT defines: `interface clojure-pod { invoke: func(name: string, args: list<value>) -> result<value>; }`
- Load with `(require '[my-lib :as lib :pod "my.wasm"])`.
- Faster, safer, edge-compatible compared to Babashka's subprocess pods.
- Acts as the escape hatch for Tier-C/D libraries that can't be ported.

### 8.3 WIT / Component Model timeline

| Capability             | Phase       | Note                                           |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|

## 9. Phase plan

Each phase has a goal and exit criteria. Phases marked 🔒 require an
**x86_64 Gate**: `zig build test` must pass on OrbStack Ubuntu x86_64
(Rosetta on Apple Silicon) before the next phase begins.

| Phase | Name                                                              | Exit criteria (summary)                                                                | Gate |

### 9.1 Phase 14 = v0.1.0 milestone

Phase 14 = first publishable v0.1.0. **Minimum line for a Conj talk.**
- CLI / REPL / nREPL working
- compat_tiers.yaml has Tier A/B declarations done
- Wasm Component output supported (even if minimal)
- bench/history.yaml has a locked baseline

### 9.2 v0.2.0 onward

- Phase 15-16 (Concurrency + CLJS): v0.2.0
- Phase 17-19 (super_instruction + module + advanced Wasm): v0.3.0
- Phase 20 (JIT): v0.4.0 or skipped

### 9.3 Phase 1 — task list (expanded; this is the active phase)

> Convention: each `[ ]` becomes one or more source commits, eventually
> followed by a `docs/ja/learn_clojurewasm/NNNN_<slug>.md`. Mark complete with `[x]` when
> the doc commit lands. Commit SHAs are listed alongside for traceability.
>
> When Phase 2 starts, expand it inline below in §9.4 and apply the same
> convention. Do not pre-expand future phases.

**Goal**: Read Clojure source text, produce a Form AST. NaN-boxed Value
type, error infrastructure with `SourceLocation`, and an Arena GC are all
in place from day 1.

**Exit criterion**: `cljw -e "(+ 1 2)"` reads, parses, prints back as `(+ 1 2)`.

After 1.12 is checked, the Phase Tracker (§9 table top) flips Phase 1
from PENDING to DONE and Phase 2 IN-PROGRESS; expand Phase 2 in §9.4.

### 9.4 Phase 2 — task list (expanded; this is the active phase)

> Same convention as §9.3: each `[ ]` becomes one or more source
> commits, eventually followed by a `docs/ja/learn_clojurewasm/00NN_*.md`. Mark complete
> with `[x]` and the SHA when the doc lands.

**Goal**: Wire the Runtime handle, the analyzer, and the TreeWalk
backend so that the Phase-1 read–print loop becomes a real
read–analyse–eval–print loop. Bootstrap Stage 0 = primitives in `rt/`
namespace + `(refer 'rt)` into `user/` (no `.clj` source yet).

**Exit criterion** (verified end-to-end via `cljw -e`):

  `(let [x 1] (+ x 2))` → `3`
  `((fn* [x] (+ x 1)) 41)` → `42`

After 2.11 lands as a `[x]`, the §9 phase tracker flips Phase 2 from
PENDING to DONE and Phase 3 IN-PROGRESS; expand Phase 3 inline in §9.5.

### 9.5 Phase 3 — task list (expanded; this is the active phase)

> Same convention as §9.3 / §9.4: each `[ ]` becomes one or more
> source commits, eventually followed by a `docs/ja/learn_clojurewasm/00NN_*.md`.

**Goal**: turn the Phase-2 minimum interpreter into a Clojure that
can `(defn ...)` and `(try ... (catch ...))`. Bootstrap Stage 1
loads a Clojure-level prologue (basic macros / helpers) so users
can write `(let [x 1] ...)` and `(when c ...)` directly instead of
the special-form-only Phase-2 surface.

**Exit criterion** (verified end-to-end via `cljw -e`):

  `(defn f [x] (+ x 1)) (f 2)` → `3`
  `(try (throw (ex-info "boom" {})) (catch ExceptionInfo e (ex-message e)))` → `"boom"`

> Tasks 3.1–3.4 land **first** because they activate principle P6
> ("Error quality is non-negotiable"): the runtime/error.zig
> infrastructure (SourceLocation / Kind / Phase / threadlocal
> last_error / setErrorFmt) was put in place at Phase 1.2 but the
> Reader / Analyzer / TreeWalk error sites still discard the
> location and the CLI just prints `@errorName(err)`. Wiring P6
> end-to-end before stacking `defn` / `try` / `catch` on top means
> debugging Phase 3 itself becomes tractable. CLI ergonomics
> (file / stdin execution) ride alongside 3.1 because `-e` strings
> hit zsh history expansion (`!`), `$`, backticks etc., and
> heredoc / file invocation is the safer path for tests and skills.

records Phase 3 as **DONE** and Phase 4 as **IN-PROGRESS** (🔒 x86_64
gate passed 2026-04-27). Phase 4 is expanded inline below as §9.6.

### 9.6 Phase 4 — task list (expanded; this is the active phase)

> Same convention as §9.3 / §9.4 / §9.5: each `[ ]` becomes one or
> more source commits, eventually followed by a `docs/ja/learn_clojurewasm/00NN_*.md`.

**Goal**: stand up a bytecode VM and compiler beside the TreeWalk
backend, such that every TreeWalk test passes under the VM too. This
establishes the **dual-backend foundation** ROADMAP §4.4 promises and
wires `Evaluator.compare()` as the CI-mandatory differential gate
from Phase 4 onward (ADR-0005, ADR-0022). Phase 4
also sweeps the security findings surfaced at the Phase-3 boundary
review (H1 / H2 / H3) before any external behaviour change, and
ships the `bench/quick.sh` harness §10.2 has so far only described.

**Exit criterion**: `cljw -e '(+ 1 2)'` returns `3` under both
`-Dbackend=tree-walk` (default) and `-Dbackend=vm`. Every
`zig build test` passes under both backends.
`bench/quick.sh` runs and emits a comparable per-bench number.

> Tasks 4.0 lands first because §10.2 needs a measuring stick before
> the VM begins to move performance numbers. 4.1 / 4.2 / 4.3 sweep
> the H1 / H2 / H3 findings from the Phase-3 boundary security
> review — these are not external bugs (the binary has not been
> pushed) but they are concrete latent crashes on adversarial input
> and uniform-pattern allocator-failure leaks; they get fixed before
> Phase 4 grows the surface area further. 4.4 onward is the VM
> proper.

> **Cleanup-wave smell note (added 2026-05-23, refined later same day).**
> Rows 4.13 / 4.16 / 4.17 / 4.18 / 4.20 / 4.22 landed as "skeleton
> declared, no consumer" during the cleanup wave. Per the new
> Structural imagination phase (`.dev/principle.md`), audit and
> re-scope decisions belong to **each row's owning Phase entry**,
> not to the current loop. The 2026-05-23 session executed only
> the unambiguous source-side normalisation (revert `-Dwasm` option
> in `build.zig` per ADR-0006 amendment 2, delete `binding_stack.zig`
> re-export); the ROADMAP row text is preserved so the owning Phase
> reads the as-shipped state. Related debt rows that capture the
> structural foresight from this session: **D-027** (NaN-box layout
> 第二世代), **D-028** (this audit's parent), **D-029** (value.zig
> split), **D-030** (analyzer.zig split), **D-031** (main.zig →
> `src/app/`), **D-032** (host placeholder removal procedure),
> **D-033** (primitive subdir), **D-034** (`modules/` top-level),
> **D-035** (3rd-backend dispatch extraction), **D-036** (zwasm v2
> Phase-16 inline-vs-Pod decision).

### 9.6.x Dependency graph (Phase 4 task ordering)

For autonomous execution, the 33 task rows (4.0 + 4.0a + 4.1-4.25 +
4.26.a-f) decompose into clusters that can run in parallel and a
critical path that must run in sequence:

- **Parallel cluster A — analyser hardening** (4.1 / 4.2 / 4.3):
  independent of each other and of the VM tasks. Earliest 3 tasks.
- **Parallel cluster B — infrastructure** (4.13 io_interface / 4.14
  debt populate / 4.15 compat_tiers / 4.20 host/): independent of
  each other and of the VM tasks.
- **Parallel cluster C — Wasm removal** (4.16): independent.
- **Critical path (sequential)**:
  `4.0 (bench) → 4.0a (build_options) → 4.4 (Opcode enum) → 4.5
  (Compiler) → 4.6 (VM dispatch) → 4.7 (Phase-3 forms) → 4.17
  (TypeDescriptor) → 4.18 (Protocol) → 4.19 (ObjectHeader) → 4.21
  (deftype analyzer recognition) → 4.22-4.25 (binding_stack /
  big_int / lazy_seq / method_table skeletons) → 4.8 (build.zig
  backend gate) → 4.9 (full test both backends) → 4.10
  (Evaluator.compare + test/diff/) → 4.11 (phase4_cli) → 4.12
  (exit smoke)`.
- **Task 4.26 (Error system migration, six sub-tasks)** runs *after*
  the critical path is complete and the dual backend is verified.
  Sub-tasks ordering: `4.26.a (Code rename) → 4.26.b (Tier D split)
  → 4.26.c (ClojureWasmError rename, signature sweep) → 4.26.d
  (~116 setErrorFmt migration by region) → 4.26.e (@panic audit)
  → 4.26.f (main top-level catch)`. Each is a separate commit;
  they can paint partial green builds because the catalog already
  ships and the Zig union rename is a search-and-replace.

Total task days (AI basis): approximately 12-16 days for the
critical path plus parallel clusters, plus 2-3 days for task 4.26
sub-tasks. Autonomous continuous execution may shorten the clock
time below the AI-day estimate by overlapping unrelated tasks
inside the same commit window.

After 4.0-4.26 land as `[x]`, the §9 phase tracker flips Phase 4 from
IN-PROGRESS to DONE and Phase 5 IN-PROGRESS (🔒 x86_64 gate);
expand Phase 5 inline in §9.7 per CLAUDE.md § Autonomous Workflow
"When the current phase's task queue empties".

> 4.13-4.25 are the V3 additions per ADR-0007 through ADR-0017
> (TypeDescriptor / Protocol dispatch / Object header lock / STM
> intent / Host extension / NaN-box ValueTag / Tier D / UTF-8 /
> io_interface / file size criterion / Allocator strategy). Most
> are skeleton-only at Phase 4 — executable code lands in Phase 5+.
> The `no_op_stub_forbidden` rule applies: a skeleton is a struct
> declaration without a fall-through function, or a function whose
> body is exactly
> `return error_catalog.raise(.unsupported_feature, loc, .{ .name = "<form>" })`
> (per ADR-0018). User-facing messages never name a Phase number or
> ADR identifier.

> 4.4 onwards is the **first time the VM actually runs code**. The
> opcode set listed in 4.4 is the **starting** set, not the final one
> — Phase 4.6 / 4.7 will surface ops missing for `loop*` / `recur` /
> `try` / closure capture. Add them via `[ ]` insertions inside §9.6
> as they are discovered, mirroring how §9.5 was filled in. ADRs are
> not required for opcode additions unless they alter ROADMAP §4.4
> ("dual backend") or §13 ("forbidden patterns") — those need ADRs
> per §17.2.

promotion, deftype / defrecord / reify activation (Tier A
behaviour), task 4.26 carry-over if any. 🔒 OrbStack gate.
**Final activation step**: flip `build_options.phase_at_least_5 = true`

`runtime/gc/stub.zig` → real `mark_sweep.zig`, swaps any other
`*/stub.zig` parallels gated by `phase_at_least_5`, removes the
catalog Codes named in ADR-0009 amendment 2 (`gc_*_not_supported`
family) and ADR-0017 amendment 1, and rewrites the corresponding
test expectations from "expect this Code" to "expect successful
op".

overlaps the Phase 7 (§9.9) protocol dispatch + Phase 6 (§9.8)
host stdlib first-wave content. Reconcile the Phase 9 scope to
match its actual focus (external Clojure modules — json / csv /
edn) before opening the task table; the current text is a
historical artefact from the pre-amendment ROADMAP.

**Decision point**: JIT go / no-go per ROADMAP §14.1.
**Entry debts**: **D-035** (extract backend-shared "callable
dispatch" layer before adding the JIT vtable — current

**Deliverables**: VM optimisation `super_instruction.zig`, five
canonical benchmarks within 100% of cw v0 24C.10, JIT go / no-go

## 10. Performance and benchmarks

### 10.1 Lock baseline at Phase 8

`bench/history.yaml` records before/after for every optimisation.
**1.2x regression on a single bench = STOP.**

### 10.2 Mid-phase quick bench (4-7)

Before the full Phase-8 harness, a `bench/quick.sh` covering 5–6 microbenchmarks
goes in just before Phase 4. Used during Phases 4-7.

### 10.3 v0.1.0 targets

| Bench             | v0.1.0 target | Stretch |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| Cold start        | < 12 ms       | < 8 ms  |
| Warm start        | < 4 ms        | < 2 ms  |
| Binary size       | < 3.5 MB      | < 2 MB  |
| fib_recursive     | 24 ms         | 18 ms   |
| map_filter_reduce | 17 ms         | 10 ms   |
| transduce         | 16 ms         | 10 ms   |
| lazy_chain        | 16 ms         | 10 ms   |
| Idle memory       | < 25 MB       | < 15 MB |
| Wasm cold start   | < 50 ms       | < 20 ms |

### 10.4 Fused reduce via structural metadata

Required by Phase 7. `LazySeq` carries `meta: ?*const SeqMeta`
(`.lazy_map | .lazy_filter | .lazy_take | .range`). At reduce time, the op
chain is walked and the base source (range, vector) is iterated directly,
producing zero intermediate lazy seqs. This is the mechanism that won v1's
391x on `lazy_chain`.

---

## 11. Test strategy

### 11.1 TDD (t-wada style)

1. **Red**: write one failing test first.
2. **Green**: minimal code to pass.
3. **Refactor**: improve while green.

### 11.2 Test layer taxonomy

5-layer taxonomy per ADR-0021 (`test/README.md` is the operational
reference):

| # | Layer        | Files                                         | Open at  |
|---|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1 | Unit (Zig)   | `test "..." { ... }` blocks in `src/**/*.zig` | Phase 0  |
| 2 | E2E (CLI)    | `test/e2e/*.sh`                               | Phase 2  |
| 3 | Differential | `test/diff/` (Evaluator.compare, ADR-0022)    | Phase 4  |
| 4 | Bench quick  | `bench/quick.sh` (informational)              | Phase 4  |
| 5 | Conformance  | `test/clj/` (clojure.test port)               | Phase 11 |

`test/run_all.sh` is the unified runner (run_step pattern per
ADR-0024, with `--list` / `--skip` / `--only` flags and a summary).

### 11.3 Dual-backend compare (Phase 4+, CI mandatory)

From Phase 4, the differential layer (`test/diff/`, ADR-0021 Layer 3,
ADR-0022 implementation) runs every case on both VM and TreeWalk
and asserts equality. **Any divergence → identify the root cause**
(decide which is correct; fix the other). CI mandatory per ADR-0005.
Phase 17 extends the comparison to a third backend (JIT) per
ADR-0022's compareThree path.

### 11.4 Upstream-test porting rules (Tier A check)

- The first line of each ported file: `;; CLJW: Tier A from <upstream path>`.
- For a Tier-B difference, mark with `;; CLJW: <reason>` per-test.
- **NEVER work around a failing test.** The choice is implement-the-feature
  or write-a-tier-demotion-ADR. Commenting out / `:skip` alone is forbidden.

### 11.5 Cross-platform gate

Phases marked 🔒 (x86_64 Gate): `zig build test` must pass on OrbStack Ubuntu
x86_64 (Rosetta on Apple Silicon) before moving on. NaN boxing, HAMT, GC,
VM dispatch, and packed-struct alignment are all arch-sensitive.

### 11.6 Quality gate timeline

### 11.8 Periodic scaffolding audit

Every Phase boundary (or every ~10 ja docs, or before a release tag),
invoke skill `audit_scaffolding`. It detects four rot patterns across
CLAUDE.md / .dev/ / .claude/ / docs/ / scripts/: **staleness** (refs
that don't match reality), **bloat** (files past their soft limit,
duplicated facts drifting), **lies** (absolute claims overtaken by
reality), **false positives** (gate / rule triggers firing when they
shouldn't). The audit produces a report; the user decides what to fix.

---

## 12. Commit discipline and work loop

### 12.1 Commit at the natural granularity of code changes

- One source commit per logical step — red, green, refactor each get their
  own commit if that maps to the work.
- Structural changes (rename / move / split) and behavioural changes go in
  separate commits.
- Never commit when tests are red.
- Never bypass the pre-commit hook with `--no-verify` — fix the issue.

### 12.2 Commit pairing (skill `code_learning_doc` — DORMANT per ADR-0025)

> **Chapter cadence suspended.** The per-concept chapter half of the
> `code_learning_doc` skill is dormant at Phase-4 critical-path close
> per ADR-0025. Existing chapters (Phase 1-3) live read-only under
> [`docs/ja/archive/`](../docs/ja/archive/). The pre-commit pairing
> gate (`scripts/check_learning_doc.sh`) is a no-op. A future
> resumption ADR re-activates the cadence; the rest of this section
> is the pre-dormancy reference.

Source-bearing commits accumulate freely; when a unit of work is ready
to be told as one story (and the cadence is active), write
`docs/ja/learn_clojurewasm/NNNN_<slug>.md` in a separate commit whose
`commits:` front-matter cites every source SHA it covers.

The full definition (source-bearing file set, the two gate rules, the
template, the workflow) lives in
[`.claude/skills/code_learning_doc/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/code_learning_doc/SKILL.md).
Do not duplicate it here — point to the skill instead. The gate
(`scripts/check_learning_doc.sh`) is the executable specification.

### 12.3 Message format

```
<type>(<scope>): <one-line summary>

<optional body explaining WHY (not WHAT)>
```

`<type>`: `feat | fix | refactor | docs | chore | test | bench`
`<scope>`: `runtime | eval | lang | app | build | tests | bench | dev`

Doc commits use:

```
docs(ja): NNNN — <title> (#<first-sha>..<last-sha>)
```

### 12.4 Iteration loop (skill `continue` is canonical)

The full resume procedure + per-task TDD loop lives in
[`.claude/skills/continue/SKILL.md`](../.claude/skills/continue/SKILL.md);
the step-by-step spec lives in CLAUDE.md § Autonomous Workflow and
is loaded into every turn's system prompt. The user invokes the
skill with "続けて" / "/continue" / "resume"; the skill reads
handover, finds the next task, runs tests, prints a brief summary,
then **immediately enters the TDD loop and runs autonomously**.

The TDD loop has seven steps per task:

| # | Step                  | Where                                      |
|---|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 0 | Survey                | Subagent (`general-purpose`)               |
| 1 | Plan                  | Main                                       |
| 2 | Red                   | Main                                       |
| 3 | Green                 | Main                                       |
| 4 | Refactor              | Main                                       |
| 5 | Test gate (Mac+Linux) | Main or Subagent (Bash) if log > 200 lines |
| 6 | Commit + push         | Main; atomic — push runs on every commit  |
| 7 | Per-task note         | Main → `private/notes/<phase>-<task>.md`  |

Chapters (`docs/ja/learn_clojurewasm/NNNN_*.md`) are written **per
concept** (every 3–5 source commits or at phase boundary), not
per task. The chapter pulls from per-task notes; that's why
per-task notes exist.

Phase-boundary review chain runs as a **multi-agent fan-out**:
audit_scaffolding, `simplify` on the phase diff, `security-review`
on unpushed commits, and outstanding chapter writing — all in
parallel subagents. The loop continues into §9.<N+1> immediately
after the fan-out synthesises; the phase boundary is not a stop
point.

The loop stops only on the two CLAUDE.md § Autonomous Workflow
closed conditions: explicit user request, or a physical block
(unrecoverable build / test failure). ADR-level design choices are
handled inline (the AI drafts and accepts the ADR autonomously per
CLAUDE.md "ADR-level designs are handled inline, not as a stop").
Push to `cw-from-scratch` runs on every commit as part of Step 6;
push to `main` is forbidden.

## 13. Forbidden actions (inviolable)

If `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and this file conflict, this file wins.

- ❌ Branching code in existing `.clj`/`.zig` for a Tier-D library (§6.4)
- ❌ Ad-hoc workarounds to make a test pass (§11.4)
- ❌ Committing with `--no-verify`
- ❌ `git push --force` to `cw-from-scratch`
- ❌ `git reset --hard` to throw away commits
- ❌ No-op stubs that mask missing semantics
  (per `.claude/rules/no_op_stub_forbidden.md`)
- ❌ Providing the JVM Class hierarchy verbatim (e.g. `java.lang.Class`
  with full reflection). cw v1 provides `TypeDescriptor` per ADR-0007
  instead.
- ❌ Using `std.io.AnyWriter` / `std.io.fixedBufferStream` (removed in 0.16)
- ❌ Using `pub var` as a vtable (use struct `VTable` + Runtime field)
- ❌ Letting any single file drift past 2,000 lines without a
  `FILE-SIZE-EXEMPT` marker (per ADR-0016)
- ❌ Running with only one backend after Phase 4 (per ADR-0005)
- ❌ Pushing to `main` (push to `cw-from-scratch` is automatic per
  Step 6; only `main` is the forbidden target)
- ❌ Leaving local commits on `cw-from-scratch` unpushed (Step 6
  pushes immediately; accumulation invites a "should I push?"
  pseudo-decision that the closed stop list does not authorise)
- ❌ Writing a doc commit that omits any unpaired source SHA from `commits:` (§12.2 Rule 2)
- ❌ Mixing source and a `docs/ja/learn_clojurewasm/NNNN_*.md` in the same commit (§12.2 Rule 1)

## 14. Future go/no-go decision points

Each row carries a per-row predicate (no aggregate count gates).

### 14.1 End of Phase 17: do we implement JIT (Phase 20)?

- **Trigger event**: Phase 17 end with `bench/jit.yaml` showing
  >2x speedup over VM on `bench/fixtures/arith_loop.clj` AND σ < 5%.
  Equivalently: v0.1.0 benches (Phase 14) within 110% of cw v0
  24C.10 → JIT not needed (transducer + super-instruction were
  enough). Otherwise → consider JIT (start with ARM64).
- **Go decision**: ADR amendment + Phase 18-20 task table expansion.
- **No-go decision**: Tier D classification of JIT, removal of stub
  code.
- **Owner**: Shota.
- **Last reviewed**: 2026-05-23.

### 14.2 End of Phase 15: switch production to std.Io.Evented?

Criteria:
- The `experimental` label is gone in Zig 0.16.x.
- Real benches show a clear win over Threaded.
- Stability is acceptable.

### 14.3 During v0.2: adopt WasmGC backend?

Criteria:
- WasmGC is stable in major runtimes (wasmtime / wasmer / V8).
- Benchmarks justify it over linear memory + NaN boxing.
- Binary size benefit.

Decision recorded before starting v0.2.0.

### 14.4 During v0.2: actually do ClojureScript → JS (Phase 16)?

Porting cljs.analyzer + cljs.compiler is large. If yes, dedicate v0.2 to it.

### 15.2 Files created on demand (do not pre-create as empty stubs)

Empty files rot. These are created the moment they have real content,
using the templates below.

#### `.dev/handover.md` — when a session ends mid-task and the next session needs context that `git log` + ROADMAP cannot convey

Framing discipline is enforced by
[`.claude/rules/handover_framing.md`](../.claude/rules/handover_framing.md)
(≤ 100 lines hard limit; driving doc; no log accumulation; no
forecast tables; no stop-rationalisation phrases). The current
`.dev/handover.md` is the canonical shape — start from a copy of
it (sections: cold-start reading order / current state / active
task / next phase queue / open questions) and shrink to fit the
session's actual state.

#### `.dev/known_issues.md` — when the first long-lived issue surfaces

```markdown
# Known issues & technical debt
## P0 — User-facing bugs        (none)
## P1 — Development infrastructure  (none)
## P2 — Correctness gaps         (none)
## P3 — Design debt
- **<title>** (<file:line>) — what is wrong, why we live with it now, trigger to fix
```

#### `compat_tiers.yaml` (repo root) — when the first `src/lang/clj/<ns>.clj` lands (≈ Phase 10)

```yaml
clojure.core:           { tier: A, phase: 14 }
clojure.string:         { tier: A, phase: 10 }
# ... one line per namespace; java.* default to D
```

When this file appears, also create `.claude/rules/compat_tiers.md`
(auto-loaded for `src/lang/**` and the yaml itself) — content lives in
ROADMAP §6 / §13.

#### `.dev/status/vars.yaml` — when Phase 2's var-tracking script lands (Phase 2.19)

Per-var status: `{type: function|macro|special|var, status: todo|wip|done|skip, note: ...}`.
Generator: `.dev/scripts/generate_vars_yaml.clj`.

## 16. Glossary

Architecture vocabulary follows mattpocock's definitions:

| Term               | Meaning                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Module**         | Anything with an interface and an implementation (function / struct / package / slice).                 |
| **Interface**      | Everything a caller must know (types, invariants, ordering, error modes, performance).                  |
| **Implementation** | The body of a module.                                                                                   |
| **Depth**          | Leverage at the interface. **Deep** = much behaviour behind a small interface.                          |
| **Seam**           | Where an interface lives (place behaviour can be altered without editing in place — Michael Feathers). |

## 17. Amendment policy

This document is a "now" snapshot. Early-phase planning will inevitably
miss dependencies that only become visible when later phases are
implemented. **Correcting such mismatches IS the maintenance work, not
an ad-hoc patch.** This section governs how to do that without eroding
the document's role as the single source of truth.

### 17.1 When to amend ROADMAP itself (vs. add an ADR-only deviation)

Amend in place when the document already disagrees with reality:

- An exit form, scope row, or task description references a feature
  whose implementation is scoped to a later phase (e.g., a Phase 3
  exit citing `{}` while map literals are Phase 5 — see ADR 0002).
- A directory / file name in §5 has been superseded by an ADR.
- A principle in §2 needs sharpening because a later phase exposed an
  edge case the principle did not anticipate.

Add an ADR **instead** of amending when:

- A genuinely new design decision is being made (e.g., ADR 0001
  macroexpand routing).
- A deviation from a §2 principle is justified as a one-time trade-off
  and should not generalise into the document.

### 17.2 The four-step amendment

When amending, do all four — none of them are optional:

1. **Edit ROADMAP in place.** Write the corrected text as if it had
   always been so. The document is a "now" snapshot; consistency
   matters more than preserving past wording. Do not add inline
   change-bars, dated comments, or `~~strikethrough~~`.
2. **Open an ADR** (`.dev/decisions/NNNN_<slug>.md`) recording the
   original wording, the new wording, and *why the mismatch existed*.
   The ADR is the changelog; ROADMAP is not.
3. **Sync `handover.md`** if its "Active task" / "Current state"
   sections cited the amended text.
4. **Reference the ADR in the commit message** that lands the ROADMAP
   edit so `git log -- .dev/ROADMAP.md` is browseable for cause.

### 17.3 Forbidden

- Editing ROADMAP without an accompanying ADR for load-bearing
  changes (anything in §1, §2, §4, §5, §9 phase rows, §11.6 gates).
- Adding a "revision history" section back to this document — the
  trail is git log + ADR + `docs/ja/`.
- Editing principle text in §2 without an ADR (always load-bearing).
- "Quiet" renumbering of `§N` headings; if a renumber is unavoidable,
  it gets its own ADR and a sweep of every `§N.M` reference under
  `.claude/`, `.dev/`, `docs/ja/`, and source comments.

### 17.4 ADR Status lifecycle

ADRs progress through these statuses:

- **Proposed** — under discussion, not yet implemented.
- **Accepted** — implemented and active deviation from the baseline
  ROADMAP.
- **Superseded by ADR-NNNN** — replaced by a later ADR.
- **Closed (Phase N DONE)** — phase boundary made the ADR irrelevant.
- **Demoted to .dev/lessons/<file>** — observational learning only.

Status changes are recorded in the ADR's `## Revision history`
section. `scripts/check_adr_history.sh` (pre-commit gate) requires
the section on every ADR.

### 17.5 Why this exists

Without 17.1–17.3 the project drifts in one of two failure modes:

- ROADMAP turns into an aspirational document that nobody updates
  because every change "feels like ad-hoc" and is delayed indefinitely.
- ROADMAP becomes a free-form scratchpad with edits scattered across
  history, and the "single source of truth" claim quietly dies.

The four-step amendment keeps the ROADMAP correct as a present-tense
plan while preserving full traceability through ADRs and git log.
