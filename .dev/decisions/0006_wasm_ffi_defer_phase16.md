# 0006 — Defer Wasm FFI to Phase 16 via the Pod boundary

## Context

cw v0 bundled a "Clojure runtime" and a "Wasm host" into the same
binary. The `cljw.wasm` namespace exposed 17 Wasm-host vars; the
runtime had to initialize zwasm v1, manage GC finalizers for Wasm
modules, and carry `wasm_module` / `wasm_fn` GC types. The complexity
contributed to the bootstrap fragility and the std.Io migration outage
(F140-F144).

zwasm v2 is still stabilizing (Phase 9, Windows reconcile in flight),
so coupling cw v1 to it now would replay v0's pain.

## Decision

cw v1 does not implement Wasm FFI from Phase 4 through Phase 15. The
build flag `-Dwasm=false` is the default, the `cljw.wasm` namespace is
absent, and zwasm is not a dependency. Phase 4 task 4.16 operationalizes
the removal.

Phase 16 reintroduces Wasm capability via a Pod boundary (out-of-process
or sandboxed in-process module) once zwasm v2 is stable.

Re-introduction conditions (evaluated at Phase 16 entry):

1. zwasm v2 has reached Wasm 3.0 100% PASS on three platforms (Mac
   aarch64, Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64).
2. A Pod protocol design is settled (Babashka-style is the leading
   candidate; ADR-0015 upstream reference policy may also influence
   this).
3. cw v1 has reached Tier B with `clojure.data.json` and friends, so
   the I/O surface is mature enough to wrap a Pod.

## Alternatives considered

### Alternative A — Keep the cw v0 path

- **Sketch**: continue bundling zwasm and the `cljw.wasm` namespace.
- **Why rejected**: the bootstrap complexity that triggered the v0
  std.Io outage would persist.

### Alternative B — Permanent removal (Tier D for Wasm)

- **Sketch**: declare Wasm out of scope forever.
- **Why rejected**: ROADMAP §8 still includes Wasm as a v0.2 ambition.

### Alternative C — Lightweight bundled Wasm runtime (no zwasm dependency)

- **Sketch**: implement a minimal Wasm interpreter inline.
- **Why rejected**: scope creep against the Phase 4-15 plan.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: bootstrap complexity drops sharply. The F140-F144
  class of regression cannot recur for Phase 4-15.
- **Negative**: Wasm-flavored learning material is delayed until
  Phase 16+.
- **Neutral / follow-ups**: Phase 16 entry ADR defines the Pod
  protocol concretely.
