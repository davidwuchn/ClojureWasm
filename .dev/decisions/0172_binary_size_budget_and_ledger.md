# ADR-0172 — Binary size: measured composition, per-component budget, lever ledger, and a size-claims gate (the binary-size SSOT)

- **Status**: Proposed → Accepted (2026-07-16; user-directed investigation; DA
  fork folded verbatim below)
- **Driven by**: user report (2026-07-16): the brew-installed cljw shows ~9.5-9.8
  MB while README still claimed "about 3.8 MB" — "バイナリサイズが小さい、と名乗れ
  なくなってきた". The user asked for a root-level investigation (build flags,
  Clojure/JVM/Zig angles), self-critiqued options, a concrete ADR, and a
  consolidation of every scattered binary-size mention (debt rows + ADR
  fragments) into one place.
- **Relates to**: D-515 (binary-size debt axis — re-narrowed to point here),
  D-277 (eager-comprehensiveness-vs-size standing tension), D-517 / ADR-0162 /
  ADR-0163 (envelope format + lazy-ns — the embedded-data lever folds into
  D-517), ADR-0158 (single-binary component embedding), ADR-0132 (ReleaseSafe =
  gated/shipped config), O-008 (release strip, `.dev/optimizations.md`),
  F-001 (zwasm unavoidable), F-002 (finished-form wins), F-011 (behavioural
  equivalence), F-013 clause 4 (comprehensiveness bounded by single-binary
  cost), F-014 (scope goal line).

## Context

### The incident, and why the old targets died

The shipped macOS arm64 binary (v1.3.1, ReleaseSafe, `-Dwasm`, stripped) is
**9,469,816 bytes (~9.5 MB decimal)**. Four tracked documents disagreed with
that reality and with each other:

| Location                         | Stale claim                             |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `README.md` (Features)           | "about 3.8 MB"                          |
| `ROADMAP.md` §"No JVM" top-line | "target binary ≤ 5 MB"                 |
| `ROADMAP.md` §10.3 targets      | "< 3.5 MB target / < 2 MB stretch"      |
| `.dev/debt.yaml` D-515           | "8.8 MB (incl. a ~1.4 MB … blob)"      |
| `test/run_all.sh` comment        | "ReleaseSafe ≈ 3.5 MB … exceeds 8 MB" |

The pre-engine targets were not merely missed — they became **arithmetically
unreachable the day F-001's engine landed in the text segment**: the embedded
zwasm engine + component-model API alone is ~3.0 MB of code, i.e. F-001's
mandatory payload exceeds the old §10.3 target by itself. The binary grew
because the differentiator (Wasm FFI with an embedded JIT) and the
comprehensiveness laws (F-013/F-014: full-Unicode UCD tables, spec.alpha
bundled, CIDER-fidelity nREPL, TLS-capable http client) landed. The growth is
a consequence of the mission; the rot was that no mechanism compared any prose
claim against the measured artifact. Both problems are fixed here: honest
numbers derived from measurement, and a gate that keeps them honest.

### Measured composition (2026-07-16, macOS arm64, v1.3.1 config)

Total 9,469,816 B. Method: `scripts/binary_size_report.sh` (this ADR's tool)
+ symbol attribution on a `-Dprofile=true` build.

| Component                              | Size     | Notes                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `__text` (code)                        | 6.90 MB  | breakdown below                                                                  |
| — zwasm (engine/api/validate/ir/…)   | 2.99 MB  | 44% of code; `engine.codegen.arm64.emit.compile` alone 691 KB                    |
| — cljw proper (runtime/lang/eval/app) | 2.57 MB  | 38% of code                                                                      |
| — Zig std                             | 1.17 MB  | incl. std.crypto TLS 0.43 MB (https client), std.sort monomorphizations 0.22 MB  |
| `__const` + `__cstring` (data)         | 1.59 MB  | AOT bytecode blob 698 KB + raw `.clj` sources 451 KB + UCD tables ~207 KB + misc |
| `__eh_frame` + `__unwind_info`         | 0.75 MB  | unwind tables                                                                    |
| headers / `__LINKEDIT` / misc          | ~0.23 MB |                                                                                  |

Supporting facts: the whole binary gzips to 2.8 MB (the release tarball) —
high code redundancy, typical of monomorphized Zig; symbols are already
stripped (O-008); `zig build` release config already omits debug info.

### Optimize-mode measurements (same source, same flags otherwise)

| Config                              | Bytes     | Δ vs shipped | Trade                                       |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ReleaseSafe (shipped)               | 9,469,816 | —            | —                                          |
| ReleaseSafe + `unwind_tables=.none` | 8,731,096 | −739 KB       | see L1 (measured cost ≈ zero)              |
| ReleaseFast                         | 8,172,744 | −1.30 MB      | drops all safety checks                     |
| ReleaseSmall                        | 4,841,624 | −4.63 MB      | drops safety checks + speed (unbenchmarked) |

(`error_tracing=false` was measured a no-op: `strip=true` already disables
error-return tracing — the probe binary prints "stack tracing is disabled"
on panic with and without unwind tables.)

## Decision

### 1. This ADR is the binary-size SSOT

Composition, budget, and lever dispositions live **here**. D-515 is re-narrowed
to the drain anchor pointing at this ledger; the four stale claims above are
corrected in the same commit; `scripts/binary_size_report.sh` is the
measurement recipe (report mode) and the enforcement (check mode).
`bench/history.yaml`'s `binary_size_bytes` remains the bench-side time series;
the user-facing per-release record is CHANGELOG (each release entry states the
measured size per platform from this release on).

**Reference platform** for every number in this ledger: macOS arm64,
ReleaseSafe, `-Dwasm`, stripped (= the brew artifact). The Linux x86_64
`-Dcpu=baseline` deploy artifact is recorded at each release alongside it
(expected within ~±15%; the v1.3.1 Linux tarball implies ~10 MB uncompressed).

### 2. Per-component budget (derived ceiling, not a reverse-engineered line)

Size growth is feature-coupled (F-013/F-014 guarantee it), so the budget is
per-component with explicit headroom; the total ceiling **derives** from the
components, and a breach localizes itself via the report tool:

| Component              | Measured (2026-07-16) | Budget                             | Headroom rationale                                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| zwasm (engine + api)   | 1.94 MB               | 2.5 MB                             | thunk collapse landed (v2.2.1); x86_64 emitter is comptime-gated (0 B on arm64) |
| cljw text              | 2.57 MB               | 3.5 MB                             | F-013/F-014 comprehensiveness growth                            |
| Zig std text           | 1.17 MB               | 1.5 MB                             |                                                                 |
| embedded data          | 1.59 MB               | 1.75 MB                            | re-set to **1.0 MB** when L2 lands                              |
| unwind + linkedit etc. | 0.23 MB               | 0.3 MB                             | L1 LANDED 2026-07-16 (O-052): tables dropped, budget re-set     |
| **Derived ceiling**    | **8.73 MB**           | **≈ 11 MB → ≈ 10.3 MB post-L2** |                                                                 |

A component crossing its budget line triggers: attribute (report tool) →
either a lever lands or the budget line is consciously amended **in this ADR**
(Revision history entry). Never silently.

### 3. Size-claims gate (the recurrence-prevention mechanism)

`test/run_all.sh` gains the `size_claims` step (full gate, after
`build_cljw`): `scripts/binary_size_report.sh --check` fails when README's
headline "<N> MB" claim drifts >10% from the freshly built binary. This is the
house pattern (check_clj_attribution / check_smell_audit): closed structurally,
not by vigilance (F-013 clause 3). A prose size claim can no longer rot 2.5×.

### 4. Lever ledger (each with a measured/estimated Δ and a disposition)

- **L1 — `unwind_tables = .none` on release builds: LANDED 2026-07-16 (O-052;
  shipped size 9,469,816 → 8,731,096 B).** Original disposition:
  Measured −739 KB. Measured cost ≈ zero: the stripped shipped binary
  *already* prints no native stack trace on a Zig-level panic (probe
  2026-07-16, "stack tracing is disabled" both ways); cljw renders Clojure
  errors from its own StackFrame stack (O-008). arm64-macOS keeps frame
  pointers, so an attached debugger can still walk frames post-mortem.
  Keep unwind tables on Debug (and under `-Dprofile`).
- **L2 — embedded-data shrink, folded into D-517's envelope-format redesign:
  ADOPT-with-D-517** (one format decision, not two). Shape: eager core region
  stays uncompressed for D-517 zero-copy in-place reads; **lazy lib regions +
  raw `.clj` sources are flate-compressed** (measured: blob 698→112 KB flate,
  `.clj` 451→125 KB; decompressing the *whole* blob costs 0.46 ms, and lazy
  regions decompress only on `require`). **Format compaction is evaluated in
  the same pass** (varint operands, cross-region constant-pool dedup) — it
  attacks the same bytes with no decompression copy and no RSS cost.
  Estimated −0.9 to −1.1 MB. Co-decide in D-517; do not build the format twice.
- **L3 — ship ReleaseSmall as the default artifact: REJECT.** Halves the
  binary (4.84 MB measured) but drops every Zig safety check from the shipped
  runtime; ADR-0132's shipped==gated ReleaseSafe identity stands. Recorded for
  perspective; a user who wants a minimal binary can build one.
- **L4 — hybrid: zwasm module compiled ReleaseSmall under a ReleaseSafe cljw:
  REJECT for the untrusted-input path; PENDING CODEV split otherwise.** The
  wasm parser/validator/JIT-emitter processes attacker-controlled `.wasm`
  bytes — exactly where ReleaseSafe's checks earn their keep; stripping them
  there is a safety regression, not a size win. If zwasm ever splits
  compute-only internals into a separate module, the hybrid can be re-scored
  for that module alone (bundle with the L5 CODEV request).
- **L5 — zwasm-side size campaign: FILE via CODEV** (co-developed, so
  tractable). Targets: the 691 KB monolithic `engine.codegen.arm64.emit.compile`
  (table-driven encoding), comptime-gating component-model surfaces cljw never
  calls. The zwasm budget line (4.0 MB) is the contract this campaign defends
  while x86_64 JIT lands.
- **L6 — monomorphization dedup (cljw-actionable): ADOPT opportunistically.**
  std.sort instantiations alone are 0.22 MB (many ~20-28 KB `sort.block`
  clones); type-erased comparator shims and `std.fmt` surface narrowing are
  classic Zig size work with no safety/startup trade. Driven by the report
  tool's symbol output; batch with L1's cycle or a quality-loop unit.
- **L7 — UCD table re-encoding: LOW.** Two-stage packed tables could halve the
  ~207 KB rodata (generator: `scripts/gen_unicode_case.py`). Take only when
  touching the generator anyway.
- **L8 — drop the raw `.clj` sources: REJECT.** They are load-bearing three
  ways: bootstrap-error `SourceContext` line rendering, `cljw build`'s
  re-envelope of user programs, and the non-AOT fallback path
  (`clojure.repl/source` notably does NOT read them — it throws honest
  not-available, D-513). Their fate is compression under L2.
- **L9 — feature-gate the TLS client: REJECT.** 0.43 MB buys an https-capable
  `slurp`/http client; a runtime whose http can't do https is a partial-class
  trap (F-014). Optional micro-probe: verify unused cipher-suite/cert-path
  code is actually dead-stripped.
- **L10 — UPX / binary packers: REJECT.** macOS AMFI kills modified/packed
  binaries (memory: `macos_cp_binary_breaks_codesign`); also opaque to the
  report tool and to users.

**Landing order**: L1 (single build.zig line, next cycle) → L2 inside the
D-517 unit → L6/L7 opportunistic. L5 filed via the CODEV channel
(`.dev/zwasm_capabilities.md` / `from_cljw`). Projected post-L1+L2 shipped
size: **~7.6-7.8 MB** on the reference platform.

### 5. Narrative posture (README)

README states the **measured** size (kept honest by the gate) and frames it
against verified peers: babashka 1.12.217's native binary is 70,933,648 B
(~71 MB, measured locally 2026-07-16) — cljw is ~7.5× smaller *with* an
embedded Wasm JIT engine. "Small" remains earned in the runtime's class;
the 3.8 MB era is not the claim anymore.

### 6. Ledger reconciliations in this commit

- **D-515**: re-narrowed — points here for composition/budget/levers; keeps
  the standing drain-anchor role; stale 8.8 MB / 1.4 MB figures corrected.
- **D-277**: status updated — the size half of the tension now has a
  mechanism (budget + gate); the startup half was discharged by ADR-0163
  lazy-ns. The tension itself remains standing (comprehensiveness keeps
  consuming the cljw-text/data budgets) but is observable, not vigilance-based.
- **D-517**: barrier gains the L2 fold-in (compression + compaction co-decided
  with zero-copy in ONE format redesign).
- **ROADMAP**: top-line "≤ 5 MB" and §10.3 "< 3.5 MB" amended per §17 (this
  ADR is the amendment record).
- **`test/run_all.sh`**: stale size-heuristic comment rewritten; `size_claims`
  step added.

The accepted Decision above **is** Alt 2 with Alt 3's report tool and CODEV
campaign composed in; every (a)/(b)/(c) critique item was folded (F-001
arithmetic stated, per-component budgets with headroom, `size_claims` gate,
L4 re-scored on safety, L1 probed before ADOPT, compaction added to L2, L8/L9
dispositions grounded, platform binding declared, peer number measured).

## Consequences

- Binary-size claims can no longer rot silently: the full gate fails on >10%
  README drift, and each release's CHANGELOG entry records the measured bytes.
- The old "small binary" marketing number is retired honestly; the story
  becomes "9.5 MB single static binary including a Wasm JIT engine, ~7.5×
  smaller than babashka; ~7.6-7.8 MB after the queued levers".
- D-517's format redesign becomes the single owner of every embedded-data
  byte decision (zero-copy + compression + compaction), preventing a
  twice-built format.
- The zwasm budget line creates the first cross-repo size contract; the CODEV
  request (L5) carries measured targets instead of a vague "make it smaller".
- Risk: the per-component budget table requires re-measurement discipline at
  budget-relevant moments (release, big feature). Mitigation: the report tool
  makes a measurement a one-command act; the gate keeps at least the headline
  honest even if a component drifts between audits.

## Revision history

- **2026-07-16 (L5 outcome — same day)**: zwasm accepted the CODEV request
  (their ADR-0204) and shipped **v2.2.1** same-day: the JIT host-callback
  thunk collapse (`api.jit_host_bridge` 1,311 → 232 KB, −82%) — measured
  cljw effect on re-pin: **8,583,352 → 7,499,896 B (−1,083 KB)**. The
  table-driven-emitter half of L5 is **REFUTED by zwasm's reversible
  experiment**: `emit.compile`'s 707 KB is once-called-handler AGGREGATION,
  not duplication — out-lining was size-neutral (+28.8 KB, reverted).
  Lesson folded into the ledger method: symbol-size attribution overstates
  recoverable size when the code under a symbol has a single call site; the
  predictive metric is instantiation/call-site count. zwasm budget line
  re-set 4.0 → 2.5 MB (measured 1.94); derived ceiling ≈ 11 → ≈ 9.5 MB
  (≈ 8.8 post-L2). Corrections also adopted: the x86_64 emitter already
  exists (comptime-gated, 0 B on arm64).

- **2026-07-16 (same day, campaign start)**: L1 landed (O-052) — shipped
  ReleaseSafe 9,469,816 → 8,731,096 B; unwind/overhead budget line re-set to
  0.3 MB per the Decision's own re-set clause; derived ceiling ≈ 12 → ≈ 11 MB
  (≈ 10.3 MB once L2 lands). Public comparison page
  `docs/works/binary_size.md` (measured 2026-07-16 industry survey) landed as
  the narrative-posture realization of Decision §5.

## Affected files

- `scripts/binary_size_report.sh` (new — report + check modes)
- `test/run_all.sh` (`size_claims` step; stale comment rewritten)
- `README.md` (honest size + verified peer comparison)
- `.dev/ROADMAP.md` (top-line + §10.3 amendments, §17 procedure)
- `.dev/debt.yaml` (D-515 re-narrow, D-277 update, D-517 L2 fold-in)
- `.dev/handover.md` (resume pointer)
