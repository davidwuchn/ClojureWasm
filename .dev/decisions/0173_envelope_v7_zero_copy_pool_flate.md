# ADR-0173 — Envelope format v7: executable wire instructions (zero-copy), lazily-materialized constant pool, flate-compressed lazy regions

- **Status**: Proposed → Accepted (2026-07-16; DA fork folded verbatim below —
  its four required changes are all adopted in this Decision)
- **Driven by**: D-517 (zero-copy in-place deserialize, ADR-0162 step 3 — the
  ~2.1 ms deserialize half of the cold floor) **co-decided with** ADR-0172 L2
  (embedded-data size lever: −0.9〜1.1 MB) per ADR-0172's "one format decision,
  not two". Step-0 survey: `private/notes/D517-envelope-survey.md` (+ Step 0.6
  amendments).
- **Relates to**: ADR-0034 (format-version policy: decoder-only permanent
  compatibility + `docs/spec/formats/<version>.edn` archive), ADR-0118 (VM
  error locations — per-instr line:col on compiled chunks; amended by this ADR:
  AOT chunks gain real `source_file` labels), ADR-0162/0163 (cold-start
  architecture / region blob), ADR-0172 (size SSOT), D-515, F-004 (NaN-box law
  — no raw Value archiving), F-006 (heap Values built at runtime), F-011/F-012
  (dual-backend oracle green per commit).

## Context (measured, 2026-07-16)

- Blob 698,159 B / 31 regions; eager 434 KB (62%), lazy 264 KB. 28,637 eager
  instructions decode element-wise 3 B wire → 12 B memory (alloc + copy).
  Constants dominate chunk bytes (977 KB of 1.17 MB decoded); instrs are
  135 KB — so the pool, not the instr copy, is likely the bigger half of the
  2.1 ms. Per-step attribution is mandatory during the arc
  (`CLJW_PROFILE_STARTUP=1`).
- **42% of the blob (~294 KB) is duplicate interned-name encoding**: 15,907
  interned-name constant occurrences, only 3,342 unique (`var
  clojure.core/list` ×1,141). Net size win after pool+refs bookkeeping
  ≈ −230 KB (u32 refs = 63.6 KB + unique pool ≈ 60 KB replace ~294 KB+uniques
  of inline encoding). Dedup also cuts intern/hash calls ~5×.
- 97.7% of operands < 128, **but** varint decoding forces a copy — it
  structurally conflicts with zero-copy, and flate covers the wire-size win
  for the lazy half.
- `@embedFile` guarantees alignment 1; in-memory `Instruction` is auto-layout
  12 B (opcode u8 / operand u16 / line u32 / column u16); AOT chunks always
  carry line=0 col=0 (ADR-0118).
- **`readValue` precondition (DA-verified, load-bearing)**: the var_ref arm
  (serialize.zig:455) requires the namespace to ALREADY exist at decode time;
  type_descriptor likewise requires the defining chunk to have RUN. Today this
  is guaranteed only by interleaved chunk-by-chunk decode+run. Any design that
  decodes all constants up front breaks it (or, "fixed" by forward-creating
  namespaces, becomes an F-011 regression: `(find-var 'clojure.set/union)`
  must fail before `(require 'clojure.set)` as in clj).
- flate: whole-blob decompress measured 0.46 ms (~0.3 ms for the eager 434 KB);
  lazy regions decompress only on `require`; `.clj` sources 451 KB → ~125 KB.
  Zig 0.16 `std.compress.flate` direct-mode recipe verified against the pinned
  std (fixed reader → `.raw` container → `readSliceAll` into an exact
  `uncompressed_len` buffer; no window buffer, no hidden alloc).

## Decision

1. **WireInstr — the only instruction representation the VM executes.**
   4-byte `extern struct { opcode: u8, reserved: u8, operand: u16 LE }`.
   `reserved` MUST be 0 and is validated at load (corruption tripwire +
   forward space; a u24 `operand_ext` was considered — operand-space pressure
   exists (`DEF_NAME_IDX_MAX` 13-bit, fused-op 8-bit packing) but has no
   measured need yet). `BytecodeChunk.instructions: []const WireInstr` with a
   parallel `locs: ?[]const InstrLoc` sidecar.
   **Split-at-finalize (DA recommendation adopted)**: the compiler's
   build-time representation KEEPS the 12 B loc-carrying `Instruction`, so
   emit/patchJump/peephole/fusion rewrites carry loc atomically with no
   lockstep hazard; `finalize` performs the one split into
   `[]WireInstr + []InstrLoc`. Guards: (i)
   `assert(locs == null or locs.?.len == instructions.len)` at finalize; (ii)
   a NEW e2e asserting exact line:col of a VM error raised AFTER a fused
   compare-branch and after a peephole-modified region (the diff oracle
   compares values, not error locations — it does NOT cover this); (iii) the
   C1 representation change is A/B'd in isolation (protocol below) with an
   explicit revert trigger.
2. **Zero-copy over aligned bytes; ONE decoder.** Aligned embed wrapper
   (comptime copy into `align(8)` rodata) + the serializer pads each chunk's
   instr section to 4-byte offsets from blob start;
   `deserializeChunkInPlace` slices instrs via `bytesAsSlice` after a linear
   **opcode-validation scan** (`WireInstr.opcode` stays raw u8; the scan
   preserves the `DeserializeError` fail-closed contract — critical for CLJC
   user files, where reinterpret-without-validation would turn a bad byte into
   dispatch-time UB/panic). Endianness: `comptime assert(little)` — the dead
   non-LE runtime fallback is NOT kept (all shipped targets are LE;
   an unreachable fallback is the permanent-dead-path shape the project
   forbids). The copying decoder survives the arc only until C3′ replaces its
   callers, then is deleted. Byte sources are three, one code path: rodata
   (eager), `rt.load_arena` (lazy decompressed), and the **CLJC artifact
   payload read into a kept-alive 4-aligned session buffer** (fn constants
   capture their chunks — the buffer must outlive them; audited in C3′).
   Ownership: in-place chunks are borrowed views + per-chunk mutable side
   arrays (`call_sites` cache); the tree_walk.zig:401 freeChunk recursion is
   audited in C3′ and deleted where the borrowed shape makes it moot.
3. **Constant pool — lazily-materialized name-slots (DA-corrected shape).**
   The pool section stores **tag + name bytes** (deduped); the runtime pool is
   a slot array (`[]?Value`-shaped) where a slot materializes through the
   EXISTING `readValue` arms on first reference by a decoding chunk — this
   preserves resolution timing exactly (the first referencing chunk resolves
   precisely when today's inline copy would have; 2nd+ duplicates memoize to
   the same interned Value, observationally identical), keeps the ~5×
   intern/hash dedup and the size win, and avoids eagerly compiling pooled
   regexes for never-required lazy namespaces. Pool refs are **u32**
   (boring-safe; no overflow class for `cljw build` user payloads — a u16
   variant would need a fail-closed `PoolOverflow`; the 32 KB delta is not
   worth the failure mode). GC rooting: interned symbols/keywords need no
   root; pooled gc-managed Values (strings, regexes) make the slot array a
   published root — one root slot + `GC-ROOT:` marker + `.dev/gc_rooting.md`
   row, tracing filled slots only. Artifact payloads carry their own
   self-contained pool.
4. **Flate lazy regions + `.clj` sources** (`.raw` container + explicit
   `u32 uncompressed_len` per compressed region — raw has no framing; MUST in
   the spec). Each lazy region compressed individually (per-region beats a
   super-block: first `require` dirties only its own region, sub-0.1 ms each;
   the flate-window ratio loss across small regions is a few KB — noise).
   Decompressed into `rt.load_arena` on `require`; the same in-place reader
   runs over the arena buffer. The eager core region stays uncompressed for
   zero-copy (the compress-eager-too alternative is Rejected below WITH its
   arithmetic, per the DA). Raw `.clj` sources compressed with
   decompress-on-demand handles (consumers: error `SourceContext` render,
   `cljw build` re-envelope, `embeddedResolver`; `cache_gen` host tool keeps
   raw inputs). CLJC artifacts do NOT gain a compression flag in v7 (no
   measured need; user-local files).
5. **v7 rides three latent fixes**: `has_handlers` serialized (today it
   defaults true on AOT chunks → no bootstrap fn is ever frame-flattened; the
   *consumer flip* is its own commit, C6′, with oracle+bench attribution),
   `source_file` preserved (AOT chunks stop reporting "unknown" — a one-line
   ADR-0118 amendment: labels improve, line stays 0), inner `fn_val` chunks
   stop repeating magic+version.
6. **Rejected** (each with its arithmetic):
   - **Varint instruction stream**: 97.7% of operands < 128, but decode = copy;
     structurally anti-zero-copy; flate covers the lazy wire size anyway.
   - **Compress the eager region too** (DA Alt 3): kills the whole alignment
     apparatus and saves ~360 KB more binary, but costs ~+0.3 ms cold start
     every boot and converts 434 KB of clean, evictable file-backed rodata
     into dirty anon arena pages. D-450/D-517's floor axis outranks the
     residual size delta here — and the alignment apparatus is a one-time
     format cost, not a standing tax. Revisit only if ADR-0172's embedded-data
     budget line is breached after C5′.
   - **rkyv-style object-graph archiving / mmap-ELF container**: F-004/F-006 —
     heap Values are never archived as bits (the whole D-517-vs-heap-snapshot
     risk story, ADR-0162).
   - **Keeping pre-v7 decoders**: ADR-0034 — archive the spec
     (`docs/spec/formats/7.edn`), not the decoder.
   - **Eagerly-decoded `[]Value` pool** (the survey's original §5(ii) shape):
     breaks `readValue`'s findNs/already-ran preconditions; the
     forward-creating-ns "fix" is an F-011 regression. Replaced by the
     lazy-slot shape in Decision 3.
   - **Non-LE runtime fallback decoder**: unreachable on every shipped target
     = permanent dead path; `comptime` assert instead.

Projected: embedded data 1.59 MB → ~0.9 MB in-binary (ADR-0172 budget line
re-sets to 1.0 MB on C5′); eager deserialize cost mostly eliminated (instr
copy gone + ~5× fewer interns); cold floor toward sub-4 ms. Both claims are
measured per-commit (protocol below), not asserted.

## Revision history

- **2026-07-16 (C1 landing)**: Decision 1's "opcode stays a raw u8, dispatch
  converts via `op()`" was **measured at +5-6% on fib/arith** (the
  per-dispatch `@enumFromInt` ReleaseSafe validity check). Amended:
  `WireInstr.opcode` is the **typed `Opcode` field** (enum(u8), defined
  layout, extern-legal) so dispatch reads it directly; untrusted input is
  validated by a **raw-byte scan BEFORE any `[]WireInstr` view is formed**
  (C3′), so an invalid enum value never materializes in a typed slice —
  the fail-closed `DeserializeError` contract is unchanged. With the typed
  field the C1 A/B is within noise (fib 1.02±0.11, arith 1.01±0.07 and
  1.03±0.11 order-swapped, 30 runs hyperfine -N ReleaseSafe; sieve /
  map_filter_reduce neutral) — the revert trigger does not fire. Guard e2e
  `phase16_vm_error_loc_sidecar` (exact 5:6 after a peephole-elided region +
  fused compare-branch) landed with C1.

- **2026-07-16 (C2′ landing — the single v7 wire cut)**: serializer+decoder
  emit/read final v7 (4B WireInstr wire, 4B-aligned instr sections via
  chunk-body padding + 8B-aligned region starts, `source_file` +
  `has_handlers` serialized, headerless nested fn-method chunks,
  `pool_ref` 0x11 + blob-level shared pool / payload-inline pool).
  Spec archived at `docs/spec/formats/1.4.0.edn` INCLUDING the v4-v6
  backfill (three earlier bumps had violated the ADD-ONLY archive policy —
  caught by this arc). **Measured**: blob 698,159 → 544,909 B (−22%, pool
  dedup alone); shipped binary 8,731,096 → 8,583,352 B (−148 KB). Consumer
  flip (`has_handlers` flatten) remains C6′.
- **2026-07-16 (C3′ landing + measurement CORRECTION)**: in-place instr
  views landed (raw-byte validation scan → `bytesAsSlice`;
  `borrowed_instrs` ownership flag; aligned embed wrapper; copy path
  retained for misaligned/owned callers). **Correction of the C2′ note's
  startup claim**: the "6,123 → 4,190 µs (−32%)" figures were SINGLE-SHOT
  probes under load — a clean median-of-20 comparison (quiet machine)
  shows eager `runEnvelope` **neutral within noise** (baseline 3,234 µs vs
  post-C3′ 3,261 µs median; hyperfine total-startup 1.01 ± 0.12). The v7
  arc's verified wins so far are SIZE (−22% blob / −148 KB binary), not
  startup; the remaining startup candidate is C4′'s memoized pool slots
  (15.9K → 3.3K intern/resolve calls), to be judged by the same
  median-of-20 protocol. D-517's "~2.1 ms deserialize half" premise is
  itself load-suspect and is re-anchored by these medians.

- **2026-07-16 (C5′-a landing — flate lazy regions)**: region-blob index v2
  (stored-len + flags + uncompressed-len); lazy regions flate-compressed
  (`.raw`, level best) at cache_gen time, decompressed into `rt.load_arena`
  (8-aligned — the in-place instr views run over the buffer) on first
  `require`; the eager set stays raw for rodata zero-copy (compressed-eager
  = build bug, fail-closed). **Measured**: blob 544,909 → 425,125 B; shipped
  binary 7,499,896 → **7,384,984 B**. Two probe-caught bugs recorded:
  `Compress.init` asserts a non-empty output buffer (`initCapacity`, the
  cache_gen ABRT), and the zero-buffer "direct mode" Decompress recipe
  usize-underflows via the indirect rebase path under `readSliceAll` — a
  REAL 32 KB history window is required (the survey's §4 recipe is hereby
  corrected). C5′-b (compressed `.clj` sources, est −326 KB) remains.

## Measurement protocol (mandatory, per commit)

- VM-hot A/B for C1 (representation change, isolated):
  `bash bench/run_bench.sh --quick --bench=<name>` (hyperfine, ReleaseSafe
  only — ADR-0132) across fib_recursive / arith-recur loops / sieve; bar:
  no regression beyond noise (σ < 5%). **A C1 regression REVERSES the split**
  (loc returns inline; the wire can still be 4 B with a load-time widen —
  the wire win decouples from the in-memory gamble).
- Startup attribution for C2′/C3′/C4′/C5′: `CLJW_PROFILE_STARTUP=1` before/
  after each commit; the deserialize line must show the claimed step-wise
  drops (and the flate term appears honestly in C5′).
- Size: `scripts/binary_size_report.sh` before/after C5′; ADR-0172 budget
  table + `size_claims` README figure updated in the same commit.

## Sequencing (single wire cut; every commit oracle + smoke green)

- **C1** — representation split at finalize: build-time `Instruction` stays;
  `BytecodeChunk` becomes `[]const WireInstr` + `locs` sidecar; VM dispatch
  reads the 4 B form. No wire change. A/B bench + new error-loc e2e.
- **C2′** — **the one v7 wire cut**: serializer emits final v7 (padded
  WireInstr section + pool section + `has_handlers` + `source_file` + inner
  header drop + per-region `uncompressed_len` slots); deserializer reads all
  of it (may still copy instrs and materialize pool slots per-chunk at this
  commit). `docs/spec/formats/7.edn` archived HERE, once. CLJC artifacts are
  v7-coherent from this commit on — no mid-arc cross-binary window.
- **C3′** — in-place instr reading (rodata + kept-alive CLJC buffer + arena;
  opcode-validation scan; freeChunk recursion audit/deletion). No wire change.
- **C4′** — lazy pool slots wired as the constants path; intern-dedup
  measured. No wire change.
- **C5′** — flate lazy regions + `.clj` handles (ADR-0172 L2 lands; size
  numbers + budget update). Container-level change only.
- **C6′** — `has_handlers` consumer flip (frame-flattening for handler-free
  AOT fns) — VM behavior change, own oracle + bench attribution.

> (3) adopt Alt 2's decoder story at least partially (kill the dead non-LE

All four required changes are adopted: Decision 3 is the lazy-slot pool,
the Sequencing is the single-wire-cut order, Decision 2 kills the non-LE
fallback + pins the kept-alive artifact path + adopts split-at-finalize, and
the Measurement protocol + Rejected arithmetic sections carry the numbers.

## Consequences

- The envelope format becomes load-bearing/rigid (accepted by D-517's
  barrier); every future chunk-layout change is an on-rodata-format change
  with a mandatory spec archive.
- The VM's executed instruction representation changes (4 B + loc sidecar) —
  A/B-benched at C1 with an explicit revert trigger; the compiler's build-time
  representation is unchanged (split-at-finalize), so the peephole/fusion
  layer carries no lockstep risk.
- `cljw build` artifacts are v7 from C2′ on; a v6 artifact is rejected by a
  v7 cljw with the standard version error (acceptable per ADR-0034 policy;
  pre-2.0).
- RSS: worst-case all-lazy-required ≈ +264 KB dirty anon (1% of the <25 MB
  idle target); compressed `.clj` render paths dirty at most ~451 KB on cold
  error-render; today's copying decoder already builds larger dirty
  structures per region, so the net is neutral-to-better.
- ADR-0118 amendment (one line): AOT chunks now carry real `source_file`
  labels; per-instr line stays 0 for AOT.
