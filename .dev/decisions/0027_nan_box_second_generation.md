# 0027 — NaN-box layout 第二世代 (64-slot, 44-bit shifted pointer)

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-05-24
- **Author**: Shota Kudo (drafted with Claude, autonomous-loop self-accept per CLAUDE.md § "ADR-level designs are handled inline" after Devil's-advocate subagent review)
- **Tags**: phase-5-entry, value-tag, nan-box, second-generation, F-004
- **Co-issued with**: ADR-0028 (mark-sweep GC + 3-layer allocator). The two ADRs land together as a paired Accepted set per §9.7 row 5.1 — the GC needs the slot map and per-tag dispatch table; the slot map needs the GC's per-tag finaliser hook.

## Context

cw v1's NaN-box `Value` is the single most load-bearing data structure (ADR-0012). The first generation (ADR-0012, ADR-0012 amendment 1) ships **4 group × 8 sub-type = 32 slot** with group bands `0xFFF8` … `0xFFFB` and a 45-bit pointer. By Phase 4 close that layout has cost two pieces of evidence:

1. **Slot pressure**: 26 day-1 tags + the 4.23 / 4.24 amendments + the F-004 day-1 types (`range` / `map_entry` / `tagged_literal` / `string_seq` / `array_seq` / `sorted_map` / `sorted_set` / `persistent_queue` / `funcref` / `externref`) cross 32 with no breathing room. F-005 numeric tower needs three contiguous slots (`big_int` / `ratio` / `big_decimal`) and ADR-0012 amendment 1 had to scavenge the released `wasm_module` / `wasm_fn` slots.
2. **Slot-sharing pain (cw v0 evidence)**: cw v0's final layout crammed 5 reference types (`future` / `promise` / `delay` / `agent` / `ref`) into a single `delay` slot via a discriminant byte, and `ratio` + `big_decimal` shared one slot. Both cases produced debug pain that the post-mortem records as a design surrender.

User invariant **F-004** (`.dev/project_facts.md`) fixes the second-generation shape: **4 group × 16 sub-type = 64 slot, 44-bit shifted pointer (128 TB user-space address)**, day-1 enumeration of the types listed above. F-004 also commits the 4 group / 64 slot indicative slot map (Group A hot data + persistent collections / Group B callables + reader extra / Group C mutable + concurrency / Group D numeric + wasm + extension).

The 5.0 cleanup-wave audit (ADR-0026 + `private/notes/phase5-skeleton-audit.md`) bound 8 input constraints; they are quoted verbatim in §"Inputs from 5.0 audit" below.

cw v0 NaN-box archaeology was surveyed at `private/notes/phase5-5.1-survey.md` (~580 lines). The relevant findings:

- cw v0's `Tag` enum reached 45 entries (`runtime/value.zig`) with no inline back-pointer table — class-of dispatch is **string-based** through `class-of` (`predicates.zig:387-390`). cw v1 must instead build a comptime `Tag → ?*const TypeDescriptor` lookup so 5.11 TypeDescriptor activation has a constant-time dispatch root.
- cw v0 has no `TypeDescriptor` at all — classes are a comptime `ClassDef` const array (`lang/interop/class_registry.zig:54-121`). cw v1's TypeDescriptor / TypedInstance split (ADR-0007) is net-new; the Tag → descriptor table is genuinely cw-v1 territory.

## Decision

### 1. Layout: 4 group × 16 sub-type = 64 slot

Bit allocation inside the quiet-NaN payload (51 payload bits):

| Bits   | Field             | Width | Notes                                                                                                                                      |
|--------|-------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 63..51 | quiet-NaN signal  | 13    | sign (1) + exp_all_one (11) + quiet (1); band selector `0xFFF8` … `0xFFFB` for heap groups A / B / C / D                                  |
| 50..48 | band selector low | 3     | low 3 bits of `0xFFFx` (in top16 = bits 63..48). Heap: `0b000`..`0b011` = A..D. Immediate: `0b100`..`0b111` = INT / CONST / CHAR / BUILTIN |
| 47..44 | sub-type          | 4     | 16 sub-types per group → 64 heap slots total                                                                                              |
| 43..0  | pointer payload   | 44    | shifted right by 3 (align-8 invariant) → 47-bit byte address = **128 TB user space** per F-004 decree                                     |

The 44-bit shifted pointer matches F-004 verbatim: the 47-bit byte address covers the canonical 48-bit user-mode VA's user portion (128 TB) on Linux x86_64 / aarch64, macOS aarch64, Windows x86_64. F-004 is decree on this field width. 4 sub-type + 44 pointer = 48 bits exactly fills the payload below top16; **no residual reservation bit exists in the g2 layout** — the bit count is exact per F-004 + the existing top16 partition.

The g2 layout differs from g1 by widening sub-type 3 → 4 bits and shrinking pointer 45 → 44 bits. NB_HEAP_SUBTYPE_SHIFT moves from 45 (g1) → 44 (g2); NB_ADDR_SHIFTED_MASK from `0x1FFF_FFFF_FFFF` (45-bit) → `0x0FFF_FFFF_FFFF` (44-bit). The encode/decode contract (§4) preserves the align-8 invariant — `encodePointer` asserts `addr & 0b111 == 0`, which keeps the low 3 bits of the byte address zero so the shifted address fits the 44-bit field.

`int_53` (immediate 53-bit signed integer) keeps its dedicated tag band (`NB_INT_TAG = 0xFFFC`) reserved by g1 — it is not in the 64-slot group/sub-type space because it consumes the full 53-bit payload as a value, not a pointer.

### 2. Slot map (Tag enum, 64 entries day-1)

The Tag enum is decreed by F-004 — owner implements, does not re-decide. Each group occupies 16 contiguous slots; reserved slots stay declared but no-behaviour. The current best placement (subject to fine-grained shuffle within a group only):

**Group A (slots 0..15) — Hot data + persistent collections**
```
A0  string          A4  vector         A8  lazy_seq          A12  range
A1  symbol          A5  array_map      A9  cons              A13  string_seq
A2  keyword         A6  hash_map       A10 chunked_cons      A14  array_seq
A3  list            A7  hash_set       A11 chunk_buffer      A15  map_entry
```
(Matches F-004 indicative slot map verbatim. The g2 draft erroneously inserted `nil_` at A3 + `boolean_true` / `boolean_false` at D14 / D15 — see amendment 1 below for the correction. `nil` / `boolean_true` / `boolean_false` are **immediates** encoded via the `NB_CONST_TAG` band (payload 0 / 1 / 2), orthogonal to the 64-slot heap-pointer space — they do not consume a Tag slot. `hash_set` lives at A7 alongside `hash_map` (Group A's "persistent collection" cluster); the F-004 indicative map and ADR-0026 audit verdict agreed on this placement.)

**Group B (slots 16..31) — Callables + reader extra**
```
B0  fn_val           B4  var_ref          B8  tagged_literal       B12 type_descriptor
B1  multi_fn         B5  ns               B9  reader_conditional   B13 host_instance
B2  protocol         B6  delay            B10 class                 B14 typed_instance
B3  protocol_fn      B7  regex            B11 reified_instance      B15 reserved
```

**Group C (slots 32..47) — Mutable + concurrency + transient + sorted/queue**
```
C0  atom              C4  future            C8   transient_vector   C12 array_chunk
C1  agent             C5  promise           C9   transient_map      C13 persistent_queue
C2  ref               C6  reduced           C10  transient_set      C14 sorted_map
C3  volatile          C7  ex_info           C11  reserved           C15 sorted_set
```

**Group D (slots 48..63) — Numeric + wasm + extension + vector / map internals**
```
D0  big_int           D4  wasm_module       D8   matcher            D12 tail_node
D1  ratio             D5  wasm_fn           D9   tuple              D13 hamt_map_node
D2  big_decimal       D6  wasm_funcref      D10  box                D14 hash_collision_map_node
D3  array             D7  wasm_externref    D11  hamt_node          D15 reserved
```

`wasm_funcref` / `wasm_externref` at D6 / D7 are **inline-tagged**, committed by F-004 (decree). zwasm v2 §4.1 encodes `*const FuncEntity` with `align(8)` (F-008) — fits the 45-bit shifted pointer field with margin. The D-036 Phase 16 decision is **only about the marshalling wrapper** (whether `host_func.zig` exposes an additional Pod-shaped wrapper around the inline body for FFI hand-off); the slot encoding itself is decreed inline by F-004. This resolves the internal contradiction Devil's-advocate flagged on the §2 draft (cross-coupling §"wasm_funcref / wasm_externref inline reservation" row).

Anonymous reserves at C11 / D11 / D12 / D13 / D14 / D15 carry debt D-043 ("anonymous slot reservations to revisit at Phase 7 entry with the immediate-band wildcard analysis"). Per F-002 Devil's-advocate Alt 2 item 1 verdict the count should shrink; per F-003 the redraw needs measured dispatch-frequency data which is row 5.3 onward owner's territory.

`array` (D3) is Java-array compat (`Object[]` boundary for host interop). `matcher` (D8) is `java.util.regex.Matcher` analogue. `tuple` / `box` (D9 / D10) are reserved for transducer / mutable-box scaffolding (Phase 7).

**Big-int / ratio rotation**: ADR-0012 amendment 1 parked `big_int` at HeapTag slot 29 and reserved 30 for `ratio` (smallest-diff under the 32-slot layout). g2 moves both into Group D at canonical positions (`big_int = D0`, `ratio = D1`, `big_decimal = D2`). The rotation is the §9.7 row 5.2 `value.zig` split's mechanical landing; every `HeapTag.big_int` reference rotates in that commit (4 sites grep-located: `numeric/big_int.zig::init`, encode/decode tests).

### 3. Per-Tag dispatch infrastructure — owned by ADR-0028

The g2 draft of this ADR initially declared a `tag_descriptor_table: [64]?*const TypeDescriptor` here. Per Devil's-advocate Alt 1 (ADR-0020 governance: "one ADR, one load-bearing decision") + the cross-coupling §"Triple Tag-indexed table" concern, the per-Tag dispatch infrastructure consolidates into ADR-0028 alongside the per-Tag GC-trace and finaliser tables. ADR-0028 §4 hosts the three Tag-indexed `[64]?*const X` tables together (or a single `TagOps` struct over them).

This ADR commits only the slot map + bit layout + encode/decode contract. 5.11 TypeDescriptor activation reads the descriptor table from ADR-0028 §4; 5.3 GC implementation reads the trace + finaliser tables from the same.

### 4. Encode / decode contract

`runtime/value/nan_box.zig` exports two pairs:

```zig
pub fn encodePointer(tag: Tag, ptr: *anyopaque) Value;
pub fn decodePointer(v: Value) *anyopaque;
pub fn encodeImmediate(tag: Tag, payload: u44) Value;   // for inline funcref / externref (44-bit per F-004)
pub fn decodeImmediate(v: Value) u44;
```

The `align(8)` invariant on pointer payloads is asserted in `encodePointer` via `std.debug.assert(@intFromPtr(ptr) & 0b111 == 0)`. Heap allocator (`gc_alloc`) guarantees the alignment per ADR-0028 §3.

### 5. Migration scope (cw v1 Phase 1-4 source rewrite)

The g1 → g2 surgery rewrites:

- `runtime/value.zig` — split per ADR-0029 alias (D-029) into `runtime/value/{value.zig, nan_box.zig, heap_tag.zig, heap_header.zig}` (§9.7 row 5.2 owns the split mechanics + decreed file boundary per `.dev/structure_plan.md`).
- `Tag` enum widens from 32 entries → 64. Every existing `@enumFromInt(u5, …)` / `@intFromEnum(Tag)` site widens to `u6`. **Pre-migration grep count** (mechanical surface estimate so 5.2 owner does not under-budget the row): `rg -nE '@enumFromInt\(.*Tag|@intFromEnum\(.*Tag|@intFromEnum\(.*HeapTag' src/ test/` returns the site list — 5.2 owner runs this immediately on row open. The exhaustive `switch` arms in `analyzer.zig` / `tree_walk.zig` / encode / decode acquire new arms for the day-1 additions (defaulted to `Code.feature_not_supported` until the owning §9.7 row activates the body, per `no_op_stub_forbidden.md`'s "explicit-error stub" pattern).
- `HeapTag.big_int` rotates from slot 29 → Group D slot 0 (4 grep sites; mechanical).
- The per-Tag dispatch tables (descriptor / trace / finaliser) are new comptime artefacts landed by 5.3 alongside the GC body per ADR-0028 §4 — not by 5.2 (split commit stays minimal).

The rewrite is expected per ROADMAP §A25 + F-002. Depth 3 (cross-file refactor) is the typical depth; depth 4 only if a follow-up ADR replaces the 64-slot envelope itself.

### 6. What this ADR does NOT decide

- Per-tag finaliser dispatch — owned by ADR-0028 §4 (paired ADR).
- LazySeq `force()` mutex shape — deferred to §9.7 row 5.7 per audit bullet #2 (Zig-0.16 `std.Io.Mutex` requires threaded `Io`; row 5.7 owner picks blocking-via-`io_default` vs spin-via-`std.atomic.Value`).
- D-040 `MethodEntry` rename — Phase 7 entry per debt row; this ADR's `tag_descriptor_table` does not touch the name.
- Phase 16 inline-vs-Pod choice for `wasm_funcref` / `wasm_externref` — D-036.

## Inputs from 5.0 audit

The 8 input bullets at `private/notes/phase5-skeleton-audit.md` §"5.1 input bullets" bind this ADR. Quoted verbatim (paraphrase-loss protection per ADR-0026 §3):

> 1. GC root-set must enumerate `LazySeq.thunk` + `LazySeq.ctx` + `LazySeq.seq_cache`. … The ADR-0028 root-source list must name `LazySeq` explicitly.
> 2. `LazySeq.lock: std.atomic.Mutex` is a Zig-0.16 hazard. Per `zig_tips.md`, `std.atomic.Mutex` survives as the lock-free `tryLock` / `unlock` shape only; the concurrent semantics ADR-0009-amendment-2 specifies for `force()` (double-checked locking) may need `std.Io.Mutex` (blocking, requires `io` threading). 5.1 should not pre-commit to the shape; 5.7 owns the re-evaluation when activation lands.
> 3. TypeDescriptor's `method_table: []const MethodEntry` slice must land in a GC-aware allocator, because the namespace owning it is itself process-lifetime (`infra_alloc` per F-006). … The GC ADR must distinguish "TypeDescriptor live forever" vs "TypedInstance is a GC root entry-point through its descriptor pointer".
> 4. F-004 64-slot Tag enum expansion changes `TypeDescriptor.lookupMethod`'s receiver-classification path. … The ADR-0028 + ADR-0027 pair must show how the 45-tag table is built — comptime `StaticStringMap` over Tag? per-tag `?*const TypeDescriptor` array? — because that table is itself GC-rooted via its descriptor pointers.
> 5. `HeapHeader.gc_and_lock.gc_mark: u30` is 30 bits today. … The ADR-0028 mark phase needs at most 1 bit (or 2 for tri-colour); the remaining bits are a free-pool size-class hint candidate per cw v0's free-pool optimisation. 5.1 should record the choice of "what the other 29 bits carry".
> 6. `HeapHeader` is 8 bytes today (tag + flags + pad + gc_and_lock). F-006 free-pool needs a `next: ?*HeapHeader` link somewhere when an object sits on the free list — either inside the freed object's payload (cw v0 path) or a separate per-size-class chain. 5.1 should at least note which the ADR-0028 commits to.
> 7. D-040 `MethodEntry` collision is unresolved (deferred to Phase 7). 5.1's protocol-related text must not re-name either of the two MethodEntry types …
> 8. `big_int` HeapTag = 29 today (per ADR-0012 amendment 1). F-004 Group D moves it to Group D slot 0 (Group D base = 24, sub-type 0). …

ADR-0027 §1-5 satisfies bullets #4 (Tag table) + #7 (no rename) + #8 (rotation). Bullets #1 / #3 / #5 / #6 are ADR-0028 territory. Bullet #2 is deferred to §9.7 row 5.7 owner per the audit's explicit guidance.

## Alternatives considered

A fresh-context `general-purpose` subagent was forked as Devil's advocate per CLAUDE.md § "ADR-level designs are handled inline" (depth ≥ 2 mandate). Brief: F-001..F-008 envelope; produce 3 alternative shapes (smallest-diff / finished-form-clean / wildcard) per ADR; do not propose F-NNN-violating alternatives. Full output at `private/notes/phase5-5.1-devils-advocate.md` (~440 lines). The ADR-0027 portion is reflected here verbatim.

### Would-violate-F-NNN findings

**None.** All three ADR-0027 alternatives stay within F-001 / F-004 / F-005 / F-006 / F-008.

### Subagent summary judgement (ADR-0027 portion, verbatim)

> ADR-0027 (NaN-box 第二世代) — substantively correct. F-004 hands the loop the decree (4 × 16 = 64 slot, 44-bit shifted pointer); the ADR's load-bearing additions on top of F-004 are (a) the `tag_descriptor_table` and (b) the `nil/bool` intra-slot multiplex at A3 and (c) the slot map's *concrete* placement. Of those, only (c) is genuinely re-decidable (F-004 named it indicative); (a) is forced by ADR-0007's "primitives back-pointer to native TypeDescriptor"; (b) is forced by F-004's only-three-immediate slot map. The smells that *do* land:
>
> - **Reservation-as-bias** at D11–D15 (five reserved slots in Group D) and B15 (one reserved in Group B) — six reserves total are placed with no Phase-15 horizon argument written, only "for future use". F-002 says reservations are memos, not contracts; the ADR records them as if they were contracts.
> - **Over-scope** at §3 `tag_descriptor_table` — the table is a load-bearing decision in its own right that ADR-0020 governance would flag as "two load-bearing decisions in one ADR" (slot map + dispatch table). Splittable.
> - **Bit 0 reservation** at §1 (1-bit "future tag-bit (e.g. interned-flag)") — same smell, no use case sketched.

### Alt 1 — Smallest-diff (verbatim)

> **Sketch**: Land the 64-slot envelope and slot map; **defer the `tag_descriptor_table` to ADR-0028 §5 (per-tag GC-trace table)**. Both tables index by Tag; both are `[64]?*const X`. ADR-0028 already ships the trace table. Add a sibling field on the same per-Tag row, or co-locate the descriptor pointer with the trace fn in a single `TagOps = { trace, finaliser, descriptor }` struct. Result: ADR-0027 stops at "the slot map + bit layout + immediate encoding"; the per-Tag dispatch infrastructure (one shape) lives in ADR-0028.
>
> **Better than current draft**: ADR-0020 governance — "one ADR, one load-bearing decision". 0027 becomes purely about the *Value bit layout*; 0028 becomes purely about the *per-Tag dispatch infrastructure* (trace, finaliser, descriptor). Eliminates the §3 / ADR-0028 §4 / ADR-0028 §5 triple-table smell. 5.2 `value.zig` split commit becomes smaller.
>
> **Breaks**: Reading order: 5.11 TypeDescriptor activation now references ADR-0028 §5 instead of ADR-0027 §3. Minor. "Co-issued" framing softens.
>
> **Cost**: tiny.

### Alt 2 — Finished-form-clean (verbatim)

> **Sketch**: Same Alt 1 split, **plus**:
>
> 1. **Replace D11–D15 + B15 + bit 0 reservations with named placeholders.** F-002 says reservations are memos. Either name the type (e.g., D11 = `weak_ref`, D12 = `value_cell` for STM Phase 15, D13 = `transducer_state` for Phase 7's xform work) or **shrink the slot count to the actual day-1 + Phase 5-15 horizon**. The Tag enum doesn't need to *be* 64; it needs to *fit in* 64. If day-1 + horizon is 53 slots, declare 53 and leave the bit field at 6 bits for room — but stop pretending the 6 reserved entries are part of the design.
> 2. **Replace `nil/bool` multiplex at A3 with three separate Tag slots** (`nil`, `boolean_true`, `boolean_false`). F-004 gives 64 slots; the multiplex is *cw v0 cramming*, not a finished-form move. F-002 + F-004 say cleanliness wins; A3's "this is the only intra-slot multiplexing the layout permits, and it is bounded at 3 values forever" is the same shape of surrender cw v0 made (5 ref-types in `delay`). Don't carry forward the spirit of the surrender into the finished form.
> 3. **Decide the bit-0 reservation explicitly** — either commit to "interned-flag for keyword + symbol identity-check accelerator" (with a benchmark target), or remove the bit and widen the pointer field to 45 bits. Don't reserve "for future use".
>
> **Better than current draft**: F-002 finished-form-wins applied uniformly to the slot map (no cramming, no anonymous reservations). Bit 0 either earns its keep or is gone. A3 split lets 5.11 dispatch to the three primitive descriptors without the discriminant byte.
>
> **Breaks**: Tag count goes from 64 → ~50. ADR text changes shape. More text in the ADR; less in the source debt later.
>
> **Cost**: medium.

### Alt 3 — Wildcard (verbatim, abridged)

> **Sketch**: **Inline keyword and symbol via 32-bit interned ID + 4-bit length hint, dropping the pointer indirection for the common case.** Burn an immediate-tag band (like `int_53` at `NB_INT_TAG = 0xFFFC`) for **interned-id-15-bit keywords and symbols** + a *separate* pointer slot at A1/A2 for the overflow.
>
> **Why within F-NNN envelope**: F-004 §1.4 explicitly carved the immediate-band exception (`int_53`). F-002 finished-form-wins: keyword identity check today is `(decode_ptr(a) == decode_ptr(b))`; wildcard makes it `(a.raw == b.raw)`.
>
> **Breaks**: Big new encode/decode contract. Interned-id allocator becomes a Phase-5 dependency (Pull-forward cost). Phase 16 zwasm bridge has to know about the immediate band.
>
> **Cost**: large. If the smell sensor surfaces it twice in two phases, mint a future ADR with this body.

### Load-bearing concerns the ADR omits (verbatim)

> 1. `@enumFromInt(u5, …)` → `u6` widening at every call site is asserted but not enumerated. Grep surface count is not given. Add a count.
> 2. F-004 says `wasm_funcref` / `wasm_externref` are inline-tagged (D6, D7). §2's text says "inline-tagged per F-008 ... fits the 44-bit shifted pointer field exactly" but then §2 last paragraph contradicts: "the day-1 inline reservation is non-committal — D4 / D5 / D6 / D7 stay declared but Phase 16 entry decides whether the body wires inline or routes through Pod." So is it inline (per F-004) or undecided (per ADR text)? F-001 says F-004 wins.
> 3. Group A intra-slot density vs Group D sparseness — Group A is full (16/16, with hash_set displaced to C13 to keep A dense), Group D is 11/16 used (5 reserved). The displacement of hash_set into Group C is *itself* a smell.

### Main loop disposition

Devil's-advocate Alt 1 **applied**: §3 `tag_descriptor_table` removed from this ADR; per-Tag dispatch infrastructure consolidates into ADR-0028 §4.

Alt 2 item 2 **applied**: A3 nil/bool multiplex split — A3 = `nil_`, D14 = `boolean_true`, D15 = `boolean_false`. The day-1 demonstration that cw v1 finished-form discipline differs from cw v0's surrender (per the principle test cited).

Alt 2 item 3 **applied**: bit 0 reservation removed; pointer widens to 45 bits (256 TB shifted byte address, exceeds canonical 48-bit user VA). Interned-flag candidate recorded as `D-043` for Phase 7+ immediate-band ADR consideration.

Alt 2 item 1 **partially applied**: D11 / D12 / D13 remain as anonymous reserves (down from 5 reserves to 3 after the A3 nil/bool split moved into D14 / D15). Per Devil's-advocate "shrink the slot count" recommendation: full shrink would require re-drawing F-004's 4 × 16 group boundaries (depth-4 surgery deferred per F-003 to a Phase 7+ owner with measured dispatch-frequency data). The 3 remaining reserves are captured by debt `D-043` so the next Phase entry inherits the foresight rather than a silent reservation. B15 reservation also moves into D-043 scope.

Alt 3 (wildcard) **not applied** — recorded as a future-ADR candidate per Devil's-advocate's "not recommended for Phase 5 entry" verdict. Carried by `D-043` (immediate-band candidate analysis) for Phase 7+ owner.

§2 wasm_funcref **contradiction resolved** per Devil's-advocate Load-bearing-concern #2: ADR text aligned to F-004 (slot encoding committed inline); D-036 Phase 16 entry decision narrowed to marshalling-wrapper choice only.

Load-bearing concern #1 (grep count for `Tag` widening) **applied** as a procedural note in §5 (5.2 owner runs the grep immediately on row open to size the row).

Load-bearing concern #3 (Group A density vs Group D sparseness; `hash_set` displacement smell) **acknowledged inline** in §2 Group A paragraph; redraw deferred per F-003 to a Phase 7+ owner.

## Consequences

- **Positive**: 64-slot envelope absorbs F-004 day-1 enumeration + Phase 5-15 additions with ~10 slots reserve. Constant-time `Tag → TypeDescriptor` dispatch replaces cw v0's string-based class-of. Inline `funcref` / `externref` reservation aligns with zwasm v2 §4.1 `@intFromPtr(*const FuncEntity)` + 0 sentinel encoding (F-008) so Phase 16 entry's integration is mechanical-not-design.
- **Negative**: Tag enum widens from 32 → 64 (5-bit → 6-bit). Every existing switch arm gains 32 new cases; the §9.7 row 5.2 split commit is large by line count (~1500 lines moved across 4 files). Acceptable per F-002 (finished form wins over diff size); the alternative is a third generation in Phase 7-10 when slot pressure recurs.
- **Neutral / follow-ups**: ADR-0028 (paired) consumes the slot map for per-tag finaliser table + per-tag GC-trace dispatch. ADR-0007 amendment 1's "primitives gain a back-pointer to a native TypeDescriptor" wires through `tag_descriptor_table` (filled by 5.11). ADR-0012 a1's transient slot placement is superseded for `big_int` (slot 29 → D0); the amendment 1 history stays in ADR-0012 as the smallest-diff record.

## Affected files

- `.dev/decisions/0028_*.md` (the paired ADR — see §0 Co-issued-with).
- `src/runtime/value.zig` (split per ADR-0029 alias / D-029 at §9.7 row 5.2 into `runtime/value/{value, nan_box, heap_tag, heap_header}.zig`).
- `src/runtime/numeric/big_int.zig` (HeapTag rotation 29 → D0; init helper unchanged).
- `src/runtime/native_descriptors.zig` (new file; 5.11 lands the descriptor globals).
- `src/eval/analyzer.zig`, `src/eval/backend/tree_walk.zig`, `src/eval/backend/vm/compiler.zig`, `src/runtime/dispatch.zig` (Tag switch arms widen; defaulted `Code.feature_not_supported` for slots whose body lands later per `no_op_stub_forbidden.md`).
- Test surface: every `expectEqual(.<old_tag>, …)` referencing HeapTag rotates per §9.7 row 5.2; no behaviour change.

## Revision history

- 2026-05-24: Status: Proposed → Accepted (autonomous-loop self-accept after Devil's-advocate subagent review reflected verbatim into Alternatives considered; Alt 1 applied — §3 dispatch table moved into ADR-0028 §4; Alt 2 item 2 applied — A3 nil/bool multiplex split into separate Tag slots; Alt 2 item 3 applied — bit-0 reservation reclaimed, pointer widened to 45 bits; §2 wasm_funcref contradiction resolved by aligning to F-004; remaining anonymous reserves captured by D-043). Co-issued with ADR-0028.
- 2026-05-24 (amendment 1): Reverted §2 slot map placement of `nil_` (was A3) + `boolean_true` / `boolean_false` (were D14 / D15) — these are **immediates** encoded via the `NB_CONST_TAG` band (payload 0 / 1 / 2) per the existing g1 invariant; F-004's 64-slot enumeration is the heap-pointer Tag space, orthogonal to immediate encoding. The amendment-as-shipped: A3 = list, D14 / D15 = reserved (per F-004's indicative map verbatim). Devil's-advocate Alt 2 item 2 ("split A3 nil/bool into three separate Tag slots") was responding to the misframe in the original draft and is **withdrawn**: the underlying smell (cw v0 cramming surrender pattern) does not apply because `nil` / `true` / `false` were never crammed — they live in the immediate band and have always been independent Tag classifications (`Tag.nil` / `Tag.boolean`). D-043 reservation count updates from 3 (D11–D13) to 6 (C11 / D11–D15) to reflect the reverts; the §"shrink the slot count" verdict still applies but the redraw stays deferred per F-003. Smell trigger: caught in-flight during §9.7 row 5.2 implementation prep when reconciling the existing NB_CONST_TAG encoding against the §2 draft. Smell category: Spec-drift (ADR text drifted from F-NNN decree + existing source invariant) + Reservation-as-bias (the D14/D15 boolean placement was a contrived "extension subset" framing to host non-heap values in a heap-slot map).
- 2026-05-24 (amendment 2): §1 bit layout corrected — pointer field is **44 bits** (not 45) per F-004 decree "44-bit shifted pointer (128 TB)". The original g2 draft + amendment 1 narrative claimed bit-0 reclamation to widen the pointer to 45 bits / 256 TB byte address; that exceeded F-004's 128 TB bound and was an F-NNN violation. Per priority chain (F-NNN > ADR), F-004 wins; the ADR aligns. encode/decode contract (§4) updated: `encodeImmediate` / `decodeImmediate` payload widths change from `u45` to `u44` to match. Smell trigger: caught during 5.2 implementation prep when reconciling the existing `NB_ADDR_SHIFTED_MASK` constant (45-bit mask for the old 32-slot 3-bit-sub-type layout) against F-004's 44-bit-pointer decree. Smell category: Spec-drift (ADR text exceeded F-NNN envelope) + Smallest-diff bias.

  **Amendment 2's narrative was itself partly wrong** (corrected in amendment 3): it claimed a "1 residual bit at position 0 reserved per F-004 implicit" arising from "51-bit payload − 2 group − 4 sub − 44 pointer = 1 residual". That arithmetic conflated the 13-bit NaN signal at bits 63..51 with the 3-bit band selector at bits 50..48 — the actual payload below top16 (bits 47..0) is 48 bits, of which g2 uses 4 sub-type + 44 pointer = 48 exactly, with no residual bit. The "Devil's-advocate Alt 2 item 3 → withdrawn because F-004 violation" disposition stays correct (widening to 45-bit pointer does violate F-004), but the "bit-0 is F-004-decreed reservation" framing in §1 was incorrect.
- 2026-05-24 (amendment 3): §1 bit layout table re-corrected — there is **no residual reservation bit**. g2 partition: bits 63..51 quiet-NaN signal (13) + bits 50..48 band selector low (3, part of `0xFFFx`) + bits 47..44 sub-type (4) + bits 43..0 pointer payload (44) = 64 exactly. The `NB_HEAP_SUBTYPE_SHIFT` constant moves from 45 (g1) → 44 (g2); the `NB_ADDR_SHIFTED_MASK` moves from `0x1FFF_FFFF_FFFF` (45-bit) → `0x0FFF_FFFF_FFFF` (44-bit). 5.2.b source landing uses the corrected constants (`src/runtime/value/nan_box.zig`). Devil's-advocate Alt 2 item 3 stays withdrawn — there is no bit to reclaim or name; the layout is exact. Smell trigger: caught when 5.2.b's test gate failed on `runtime.value.value.test.F-004 day-1 Tag additions encode + decode through Group A` ("expected .range, found .type_descriptor") — the SHIFT=45 spilled the sub-type's high bit into top16's bit 48, corrupting the band identifier. The principled fix matches F-004's decree exactly. Smell category: Spec-drift (the amendment-2 arithmetic was wrong).
- 2026-05-24 (amendment 4): §2 Group D slot map names **D11 = `hamt_node`** + **D12 = `tail_node`** for PersistentVector internals (§9.7 row 5.4.a). Both are vector backing types per the survey at `private/notes/phase5-5.4-survey.md` — HamtNode is the 32-slot HAMT interior/leaf node, TailNode is the 32-element tail array. Naming 2 of the 6 D-043 anonymous reserves at this row matches the "name when a use case lands" disposition recorded in the original D-043 row text. Per F-NNN envelope: F-004's "indicative slot map" + F-002 finished-form let the ADR name a reserve when a concrete consumer lands; this is not an F-NNN amendment, just a slot-naming refinement within the F-004 envelope. D-043 reservation count drops 6 → 4 (B15 / C13–D13 / D14 / D15 remain anonymous and stay on D-043's Phase 7 entry deadline).
- 2026-05-24 (amendment 5): §2 Group D slot map names **D13 = `hamt_map_node`** + **D14 = `hash_collision_map_node`** for PersistentHashMap internals (§9.7 row 5.5.a). Per the survey at `private/notes/phase5-5.5-survey.md`: CHAMP-style HAMT node with `data_map` + `node_map` bitmaps + `[64]Value slots` for K/V pairs and child pointers; hash-collision bucket type lands at 5.5.c but its Tag slot is declared upfront so the trace dispatch table reservation is stable. Same "name when use case lands" disposition as amendment 4. D-043 reservation count drops 4 → 2 (B15 / C11 / D15 remain anonymous — wait, C11 is now `persistent_queue` per F-004 amendment 1, so B15 + D15 = 2 remain). Per F-NNN envelope: F-004 indicative + F-002 finished-form let the ADR consume reserves as consumers land.
