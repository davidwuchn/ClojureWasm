# 0055 — `binding` special form + cw v1's first dynamic var (`cljw.error/*error-context*`) + error-context capture

**Status**: Accepted (Devil's-advocate fork landed 2026-05-29)
**Date**: 2026-05-29
**Author**: Shota Kudo (drafted with Claude autonomous loop)
**Tags**: dynamic-var, binding, special-form, error-context, with-context, F-002, F-004, F-009, D-075, D-141-sibling, row-14.13

## Context

Row 14.13 deliverable (3) is `cljw.error/with-context`: `(with-context
{:request-id … :trace-id …} body)` stacks a context map on a dynamic
var; when an error event is emitted (EDN render in
`src/app/error_render.zig::formatErrorEdn`) the merged map's keys become
top-level event fields.

A Step-0.6 re-lay (survey `private/notes/phase14-14.13-binding-survey.md`
§9) found the handover's "narrow prerequisite = just the `binding`
special form" **wrong on a load-bearing point**:

- cw v1 has **ZERO production dynamic vars**. The dynamic-binding runtime
  machinery is fully built (`env.zig`: `BindingFrame`, threadlocal
  `current_frame`, `pushFrame`/`popFrame`/`findBinding`, `Var.deref`
  consulting the chain when `Var.flags.dynamic`), and both backends honor
  `DefNode.is_dynamic → Var.flags.dynamic` — but `analyzeDef` NEVER sets
  `is_dynamic` from surface syntax, and `^:dynamic` reader metadata is
  unimplemented (`(def ^:dynamic *x* 1)` → "def expects 1 or 2 args, got
  3"). Surface `^:keyword` metadata = **D-075** (a ~500-LOC Phase-7+
  feature) and is **F-004-entangled** (per-value metadata NaN-box slot is
  "未確定, decided at Phase 5 entry").
- So `with-context` needs cw v1's **first dynamic var**, and the natural
  `(def ^:dynamic *error-context* {})` will not parse.
- `binding` is also unimplemented (absent from the analyzer special-form
  set; `pushFrame`/`popFrame` have zero production call sites).
- Read-side constraint: the `binding` frame is popped (Zig `defer
  popFrame`) as an error unwinds, so by render time the frame is GONE —
  the context must be snapshotted **at raise time** while the frame is
  live. And `catalog.zig::raise(comptime code, location, args)` has **no
  `rt`/`env` access** (verified) — it only populates the threadlocal
  `Info`. So an Env-scoped slot reachable from raise is infeasible
  without rippling raise's signature across ~100 call sites.

## Decision

### D1: `binding` is a real special form (`BindingNode`), not a macro-transform

Diverges from JVM (a `defmacro` over `push-thread-bindings`/try/finally)
AND cw v0 (`transformBinding` macro). cw v1's analyzer special-form set +
dual-backend Node contract make a dedicated `binding_node` the
finished-form-clean shape: no dependency on a `var`/`hash-map`/`try`
macro chain, no per-call hash-map Value allocation, dynamic-var
resolution at analysis time. (ROADMAP A2 "features via the analyzer
surface" + F-002.)

- **Analyzer** (`bindings.zig::analyzeBinding`): even-position symbols
  resolve to their existing `*Var` (same qualified/alias/current-ns path
  as `analyzeSymbol`), NOT a lexical slot; odd-position init-exprs analyze
  in the OUTER scope (JVM parallel-eval); body analyzes in the same scope.
- **TreeWalk** (`evalBinding`): stack `BindingFrame`, eval inits in outer
  `locals`, validate each target `flags.dynamic` (else raise the new
  catalog Code), `pushFrame` + `defer popFrame()` (Zig defer = JVM
  finally), eval body.
- **VM** (real arm, no VM-DEFER — per F-002 + the handover's explicit
  "analyzer + tree_walk + vm" scope): two opcodes
  `op_push_binding_frame` / `op_pop_binding_frame`, compiled in the
  `try { push; body } finally { pop }` shape (the binding's own cleanup
  handler always pops the frame before an exception escapes its extent,
  reusing the existing `op_push_handler`/`op_pop_handler` unwind — so no
  threadlocal dangle on uncaught throw, and no new unwind path). The VM
  shares `env.zig`'s threadlocal `current_frame` (single-threaded per
  session), keeping `Var.deref` backend-agnostic.
- **Validation**: new catalog Code `binding_target_not_dynamic` ("Can't
  dynamically bind non-dynamic var: ns/name", JVM-faithful text per
  `error_catalog_only.md`), raised at eval/push time (JVM-faithful site).

### D2: cw v1's first dynamic var = Zig-registered `cljw.error/*error-context*`

`*error-context*` is interned at bootstrap into the `cljw.error` ns with
`flags.dynamic = true` set directly (no `MetadataMap` change, no reader
metadata, no F-004 value-metadata touch), root `{}`. System dynamic vars
being Zig-registered is the finished form (JVM's `*out*`/`*ns*` are
bootstrap-created clojure.core vars); this is NOT a stopgap. **User-facing
`^:dynamic`** (so users mark their OWN dynamic vars) stays deferred to
D-075 — with-context does not need it, and when D-075 lands NOTHING about
with-context changes (it was already `binding` over a real dynamic var).

### D3: read-side = global `*Var` slot + raise-time snapshot into `Info.context` + render via `printValue`

- A `?*const Var` slot in `runtime/error/` (next to the other error
  threadlocals), set when `*error-context*` is registered.
- `setErrorFmt`/`raise` snapshots `slot.?.deref()` into a new
  `Info.context: ?Value` field (default null) **at raise time** (frame
  live). Non-map / empty-map → leave null.
- `formatErrorEdn` (Layer 3) iterates `info.context`'s map entries and
  emits each `key value` pair as a top-level EDN field, rendering via the
  **canonical `runtime/print.zig::printValue`** (exists; Layer 0) — NOT a
  second hand-rolled printer.
- The slot is a **process-global**, not Env-scoped: raise has no env
  access (an Env-scoped slot would ripple raise's signature across ~100
  sites). For the single-Env CLI path (the only path that renders EDN
  error events — nREPL returns errors to the client, bypassing
  `renderError`) this is correct. The multi-Env-nREPL-EDN-error case is
  recorded as **D-142**.
- Field is **specific `Info.context`**, not a generic `Info.data`
  ex-info payload: ex-info `Info`-integration is not scoped here and a
  generic field would over-fit a not-yet-landed shape (Reservation-as-bias
  per F-002). It can generalize when ex-info `Info`-payload lands.

### D4: `with-context` = thin `.clj` macro over `binding`

New ns `cljw.error` at `src/lang/clj/cljw/error.clj` (new
`src/lang/clj/cljw/` dir) + an `@embedFile` row in `bootstrap.zig` FILES
after `core.clj` (needs `merge`/`defmacro`/`binding`). The `*error-context*`
Var is Zig-registered into the same ns before/at load.

```clojure
(in-ns 'cljw.error)
(defmacro with-context [ctx-map & body]
  `(binding [*error-context* (merge *error-context* ~ctx-map)] ~@body))
```

`merge` against the current `*error-context*` gives the stacking
(nested with-context accumulate). Reached as `(require [cljw.error :refer
[with-context]])` (F-009: `cljw.*` is the cljw-original ns family).

## Alternatives considered

(Devil's-advocate subagent, fresh context, F-NNN envelope — output
verbatim. The DA assumed raise could reach `rt.env`; the main loop
verified it CANNOT, which is why D3 takes the process-global slot rather
than the DA-recommended Env-scoped slot.)

## Selection rationale

Took Alt 1's **var-creation mechanism** (Zig-registered system var) + the
DA's **canonical-printer** clean win (`printValue` exists — feasible),
and **rejected** the DA's Env-scoped-slot recommendation on a fact the DA
could not see: `catalog.zig::raise` has **no `rt`/`env` parameter**, so an
Env-scoped slot is unreachable from the snapshot site without a
~100-site signature ripple — disproportionate, and the EDN-error path is
single-Env (CLI) in practice (nREPL bypasses `renderError`). The
multi-Env race the DA flagged is therefore latent, not manifest; recorded
as **D-142** for the nREPL-EDN-error owner.

Rejected the DA's generic `Info.data` for a **specific `Info.context`**:
ex-info `Info`-payload is not scoped here, and a generic field would be a
Reservation-as-bias bet on a not-yet-landed shape (F-002). Rejected the
full `Env.system_vars` registry per the DA's own F-003 caveat — but since
the slot can't be Env-scoped anyway (raise has no env), the registry
question is moot for this cycle.

This shape is finished-form-clean for the with-context FEATURE: when
D-075 lands user `^:dynamic`, with-context is unchanged (it was already
`binding` over a real dynamic var; `*error-context*` stays Zig-registered
like `*out*`). A primitive push/pop with-context (no dynamic var) would
be unwound by that finished form = smallest-diff bias, so it was rejected.

## Consequences

- cw v1 gains its first dynamic var + the general `binding` special form;
  `binding` is dogfooded by with-context.
- The VM gains a real `binding` arm (not VM-DEFER) — the first
  control-construct beyond `try` to share the handler-unwind machinery.
- `Info` gains an optional `context` Value field; `formatErrorEdn` gains
  a context-merge loop (only the `edn` format carries structured fields;
  `text` is unaffected).
- Process-global `*error-context*` `*Var` slot: correct for CLI, latent
  multi-Env race recorded as D-142.
- User-defined `^:dynamic` stays deferred to D-075; `binding` only works
  on system (Zig-registered) dynamic vars until then.

## Revision history

- 2026-05-29 created: row 14.13 (3) re-lay after the Step-0.6
  prerequisite-gap finding (no production dynamic var; `^:dynamic`
  reader metadata = D-075, F-004-gated). Devil's-advocate fork landed.
- 2026-05-29 amendment 1 (implementation): D3 originally claimed "Zig
  unit tests ... never set the slot." **False** — `src/app/builder.zig`
  test blocks call `setupCore` → `register`, so a test Env that
  registered left the process-global slot pointing at a freed Var,
  UAF-ing the next `setErrorFmt` (caught by the `info.zig` setErrorFmt
  unit test). Fix: `register` arms `Env.on_deinit_hook = clear`
  (env.zig) — every `Env.deinit` drops the slot before freeing its
  Vars. The slot + provider live in a new `runtime/error/context.zig`
  (not `info.zig`) so `info.zig` stays free of an `env.zig` import (the
  provider is a plain fn-pointer hook). Read-side verified for the
  catalog-error path (`(/ 1 0)` carries `:request-id`); user
  `(throw ex-info)` does NOT (it bypasses `setErrorFmt`) — recorded as
  D-144.
