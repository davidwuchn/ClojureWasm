## Resume contract

- **HEAD**: `main` (`git log` = SSOT; may lag). **NORMAL PUSH MODE**: after each
  unit's smoke-green commit, `git push origin main` immediately (Step 6).
  `build.zig.zon` `.zwasm` is SHA-PINNED (`#412966f7…`, `lazy`). Per-commit = smoke;
  full gate batches at ceiling / boundary / pre-tag.

- **First commit on resume MUST be**: **perf campaign (D-450 / ADR-0148),
  D-386 dispatch front**. RE-MEASURED + DIAGNOSED 2026-06-17 (fresh, ReleaseSafe,
  10-run, canonical `compare_langs.sh` — full detail in
  `private/notes/9.2.S-perf-remeasure-2026-06-17.md`). The 2026-06-16 baseline was
  STALE (pre-O-037..O-042). Current truth: **ratio_sum + nested_update are now WON
  (0.95× / 0.84×)**; the other 7 sit at 1.10–1.29× — gc_alloc_rate 1.29× ·
  json_parse 1.28× · string_ops 1.25× · bigint 1.20× · gc_large_heap 1.18× ·
  sieve 1.15× · destructure 1.10×. Localized construction levers (O-040/041/042)
  are MINED. **The GC/alloc-throughput hypothesis is REFUTED by measurement**: the
  D-244 #4b fix unblocked + I built ADR-0028 alloc-driven auto-collect (env, default
  OFF) and measured it — ZERO change on gc_alloc_rate / gc_large_heap (corroborates
  O-040: gc_alloc_rate is construction-bound, 0.5% malloc leaf). Auto-collect
  experiment REVERTED — plus TWO more cheap levers REFUTED (do NOT re-try):
  chunk-buffer `undefined` slots (~3% at noise floor + drops a safety margin) and
  the free-pool `pop()` empty fast-path (flat). **`-Dprofile` LANDED** (keep
  symbols on an optimised build for `sample`); the trustworthy profile shows the
  1.1–1.3× gaps are DIFFUSELY bound (per-alloc bookkeeping + VM dispatch +
  jsonToCw recursion, no single dominant cost). **So the ONLY remaining
  accessible lever is the structural D-386 (a)**: inline `stepOnce`'s per-op
  `var sp = sp_ptr.*` / `sp_ptr.* = sp` marshalling into eval-loop locals — its
  row flags it "a risky UAF-class cycle not to be rushed"; do it with FRESH FOCUS
  + the (now #4b-clean) `CLJW_GC_TORTURE_ALLOC` suite as the safety net (the
  flattened locals must stay GC-published at every alloc). JIT (c)=D-133 is
  user-fenced; a generational GC would NOT move these (not GC-time-bound).
  **Alternative high-value front while perf is structurally blocked**: §9.0 gap
  area II (Wasm-edge-native, the stated differentiator) — pivoting is reasonable
  (clj_diff_sweep Discipline 2: don't let perf-grind displace the differentiator);
  the user owns the `.dev/.perf_campaign_active` flag. Regenerate stale
  `cross-lang-latest.yaml`. DEFERRED: D-446 arity residual; D-456 defprotocol (1-line).

- **Forbidden this session**: JIT integration (D-133 — user-fenced 2026-06-16;
  the ARM64 codegen substrate is DONE + execution-verified, but the coupled
  recognizer+codegen+trigger+marshalling+oracle build is GATED behind an
  explicit user greenlight; plan in `private/notes/9.2.S-d133-jit-survey.md
  § INTEGRATION`). `git push --force*`. Bare `zig build test` WITHOUT `-Dwasm`
  (false fails — memory `zig_build_test_needs_dwasm`). Bare `zig build` for
  scripted/probe (ADR-0133 — ReleaseSafe). Measure perf only ReleaseSafe.

## Last landed (git log = SSOT; all pushed)

**Records arc complete** (D-086 / ADR-0154 + follow-ons): `TypedInstance` gained a
trailing `extmap: Value` slot (the `meta`-field twin, ADR-0112) holding
non-declared keys on a defrecord. assoc/dissoc/get/contains?/keys/vals/count/seq/
print/`=`/hash + `map->R` (via a native `rt/__map->record` primitive — bootstrap-
safe, NOT core.clj `reduce-kv`) all route declared-then-extmap; the partition
lives once in `TypeDescriptor.fieldSlotByName` (DA-fork Alt 2). `conj`/`into` onto
a record assocs into extmap (+ fixed a latent `-editable?` bug: records are `map?`
but not IEditableCollection, so `into` wrongly took the transient path). **AD-035**
records the lone clj divergence (record prints simple `#R{…}`, not `#user.R{…}` —
the AD-003 simple-name policy). clj-diff verified faithful across
assoc/dissoc/get/keys/vals/count/seq/merge/select-keys/find/update/reduce-kv.

## Cold-start reading order (resume)

handover → `.dev/project_facts.md` (F-002/F-006/F-015) → ADR-0148 (perf campaign
goal + landed O-037..O-040 + the 9-target table + conversion-group next-front) →
`.dev/perf_campaign_essence.md` (exploration modes + experiment-revert) → D-450
row in `.dev/debt.yaml` → `bench/README.md` (measured scoreboard). Perf measured
ReleaseFast/ReleaseSafe only (memory `perf-measure-release` /
`verify-against-releasesafe-binary`); each optimization gets its own ADR + DA
fork. memory `direct-explore-fork-mechanical` + `perf-beat-python-every-bench`.
