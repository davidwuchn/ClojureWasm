> Updated at session end; reads in < 30 sec at cold start.

## Next 6 files to read (cold-start order)

1. `.dev/handover.md` (this file) — recent landings + guardrail
   refresh log + active task pointer.
2. `CLAUDE.md` § Project spirit (top section, governs all other
   rules) + § Autonomous Workflow (Step 0 → 7 + the **3-condition
   closed stop list**, condition 3 = smell-cluster trip).
3. `.dev/project_facts.md` — **user-declared invariants the loop
   must treat as fact** even when ROADMAP / ADR text admits other
   readings. **8 entries** at 2026-05-24:
   F-001 (zwasm v2 unavoidable; carries own JIT + GC) /
   F-002 (finished-form wins; smallest-diff is tie-breaker not
   veto) / F-003 (decision-deferral on structural plans) /
   F-004 (NaN-box 64-slot day-1 incl. range / map_entry /
   tagged_literal / string_seq / array_seq / funcref / externref) /
   F-005 (numeric tower JVM-surface compatible, Zig-stdlib-affine
   internal) / F-006 (mark-sweep + 3-layer alloc; zwasm dual-heap
   with allocator injection) / F-007 (chapter cadence stays
   dormant — user trigger only, AI must not re-propose) /
   **F-008** (zwasm v2 ADR-0109 spec review + cw v1 stances on
   6 open questions; 2026-05-24).
4. `.dev/principle.md` — Bad Smell catalogue (**16 entries**
   incl. Smallest-diff bias / Reservation-as-bias /
   Progress-pressure / Silent default-shift — invisible drift
   family) + Structural imagination phase (with Scope boundary)
   + Devil's-advocate subagent mandate at depth ≥ 2 (with
   F-NNN envelope constraint).
5. `.dev/structure_plan.md` — anticipated directory tree
   Phase 5-20. Each Phase entry owner amends in place; this is
   the structural-imagination output map.
6. `.dev/ROADMAP.md` — find IN-PROGRESS phase in §9, take the
   first `[ ]` row in §9.<N>. At a Phase entry, read the
   placeholder's **Entry ADRs** + **Entry debts** + **Entry
   facts** lines and load every referenced ADR (incl. all
   Revision history amendments), `D-NNN` row, and `F-NNN`
   project fact.

## Current state

- **Phase**: Phase 4 IN-PROGRESS. §9.6 critical-path closed
  (4.0 / 4.0a / 4.1 / 4.2 / 4.3 / 4.4 / 4.5 / 4.6 / 4.7 / 4.8 /
  4.9 / 4.10 / 4.11 / 4.12 done). Cleanup wave: 4.13–4.25 done.
  Error-system migration: 4.26.a (Code rename) + 4.26.b
  (tier_d_form split) done. Remaining §9.6 rows: 4.26.c
  (Error → ClojureWasmError union rename) / 4.26.d (~116
  setErrorFmt → raise migration) / 4.26.e (@panic/unreachable
  audit) / 4.26.f (main top-level catch).
- **Branch**: `cw-from-scratch` (long-lived; push free after gate
  green; never push to `main`).
- **Gate**: Mac 12/12 + OrbStack Ubuntu x86_64 11/11 green at
  HEAD. 🔒 fresh OrbStack run due at Phase 4 close.
- **Chapter cadence**: dormant per ADR-0025; existing chapters
  under `docs/ja/archive/`. `private/notes/<task>.md` continues.
- **Unpaired source SHAs**: irrelevant during dormancy. Resumption
  ADR re-engages chapter cadence.

## Guardrail refresh (post-2026-05-23 session)

User-directed correction across two waves:

**Wave 1 — guardrails**:

- **Project spirit** — added to CLAUDE.md top: finished-form
  cleanliness wins, shipping fast / avoiding rework are
  second-tier. Surgical big edits welcome.
- **Bad Smell catalogue** — `principle.md` gained 3 entries:
  **Smallest-diff bias**, **Reservation-as-bias**,
  **Progress-pressure**. P5 reframed as tie-breaker not veto.
- **Structural imagination phase** — `principle.md` new section
  governing reservation tables AND directory / file structure
  AND responsibility separation AND dependency graph. The loop
  imagines Phase 5-20 horizon, records gaps as debt, defers
  decisions to the owning Phase.
- **D-021 retired** — ADR number reservation = smell.
- **ADR-0029 → ADR-0025 renamed** — time-ordered numbering.

**Wave 2 — structural foresight debts (Phase 5-20 imagination
output)**:

- **D-027** — NaN-box layout 第二世代 (Phase 5 entry).
- **D-028** — cleanup-wave row audit, **per owning Phase**.
- **D-029** — `value.zig` split (Phase 5 entry, with D-027).
- **D-030** — `analyzer.zig` split (already above 1000 lines).
- **D-031** — `main.zig` → `src/app/` (Phase 8 entry).
- **D-032** — host `_placeholder.zig` removal procedure (Phase
  5 entry, first host class landing).
- **D-033** — `lang/primitive/` subdir restructure.
- **D-034** — `modules/` top-level (Phase 9 entry).
- **D-035** — 3rd-backend dispatch extraction (Phase 17 entry).
- **D-036** — **zwasm v2 inline-vs-Pod decision (Phase 16
  entry)**. wasm FFI confirmed unavoidable per user direction.
  zwasm v2 carries its own JIT + GC; territorial overlap with
  cw v2 Phase 5 GC + Phase 17 JIT needs Phase-16-entry design.

**Source normalisation executed in this session** (not deferred):

- `build.zig` `-Dwasm=false` option reverted (ADR-0006
  amendment 2).
- `src/runtime/binding_stack.zig` deleted (env.zig is the
  authoritative location for the dynamic-binding stack).

**Wave 3 — root-cause hardening (post-research)**:

User asked "why did all this happen on top of an already-laid
ROADMAP + guardrails?". A `general-purpose` subagent investigated
LLM long-context behaviour (2026-05-23, 24 tool uses, output at
`private/notes/llm_long_context_research.md` 523 lines) and
concluded the symptoms are not attention decay (CLAUDE.md is
re-injected every turn) but **CLAUDE.md's own "進め bias" +
autonomous loop's instruction centrifugation** (~80% combined).
Fix landed:

- **`.dev/project_facts.md`** (new) — user-declared invariants
  (F-001 zwasm / F-002 finished-form wins / F-003 deferral)
  read at every Phase entry (CLAUDE.md Step 1a).
- **CLAUDE.md stop list extended to 3 conditions** — condition 3
  is "smell depth ≥ 3 fires 2× in one cycle → ADR-phase mode
  switch" (not a stop, a mode change).
- **CLAUDE.md Step 6 + principle.md depth ≥ 2** — Devil's-advocate
  subagent with fresh context is mandatory before ADR accept;
  output embedded verbatim in "Alternatives considered".
- **`scripts/check_smell_audit.sh`** (new PreToolUse hook) —
  `git push` is physically blocked unless every unpushed
  source-bearing commit body contains `Smell-audited: <depth>:
  <one-line>`. This is the deterministic enforcement layer
  behind the probabilistic CLAUDE.md rule
  ("CLAUDE.md is a suggestion, hooks make it law").

**Wave 4 — direction confirmations (2026-05-24, post-research)**:

After deeper investigation
(`private/notes/struct_imagination_research.md`, 525 lines —
cw v0 GC + 45-tag enumeration / zwasm v1+v2 GC / Clojure JVM
140-class survey), the user confirmed directions on 4 structural
fronts. Captured as project_facts.md F-004 / F-005 / F-006 /
F-007 and threaded into the relevant debt rows (D-011 / D-014a /
D-027 / D-036) + ADR-0025 + ROADMAP §9.7 + §9.18 placeholders:

- F-004: NaN-box 第二世代 = 4×16=64 slot, 44-bit pointer.
  Day-1 type set absorbs F-004 enumerated additions (range /
  map_entry / tagged_literal / string_seq / array_seq /
  sorted_map / sorted_set / persistent_queue / wasm funcref /
  externref).
- F-005: Numeric tower = JVM-surface-compatible, Zig-stdlib-affine
  internal (BigInt via `std.math.big.int.Managed`, Ratio =
  (BigInt × BigInt), BigDecimal = (unscaled BigInt, i32 scale)).
- F-006: GC = mark-sweep + free-pool + 3-layer alloc (cw v0
  path). zwasm v2 heap remains separate; cw GC allocator
  injects into zwasm internal bookkeeping (avoids cw v0 D110
  dual-GC leak).
- F-007: Chapter cadence stays dormant. Resumption is
  user-triggered only; AI must not re-propose.

`.dev/structure_plan.md` (new) — anticipated directory tree
Phase 5-20 imagined per F-003 Structural imagination. Each Phase
entry's owner amends in place when actual decisions land.

**Wave 5 — zwasm v2 spec review (2026-05-24)**:

User shared `~/Documents/MyProducts/zwasm_from_scratch/docs/zig_api_design.md`
(zwasm v2 ADR-0109 Proposed). cw v1 reviewed it as consumer.
Findings:

- Pixel-perfect integration: §1 Allocator strict-pass = F-006;
  §3.4 heap separation = F-006 同文; §4.1 funcref encoding =
  F-004 ビット幅一致; §4.3 NaN-boxing-friendly bit ownership =
  zwasm v2 が cw v1 用に明示設計 (削られたら cw v1 設計が破綻、
  spec の continuance を要請).
- C2 alignment 懸念 (`>> 3`) は **F-004 第二世代と競合しない** —
  両 layout とも alignment shift = 3、 zwasm v2 `FuncEntity` が
  align(8) なら現状でも F-004 後でも乗る。
- §6 で zwasm v2 が cw v1 に振った 6 open questions に対する
  推奨回答を F-008 に pin。

Persisted:
- F-008 (project_facts.md) — zwasm v2 spec load-bearing 要素 +
  cw v1 推奨回答 6 個 + 構造的合意。
- D-037 (rewrite timing sync) / D-038 (5 confirmation requests
  awaiting zwasm v2 reply) / D-039 (io_interface vs WASI 責務
  分離) を debt.md に追加。
- D-036 description を F-008 反映に更新。
- ROADMAP §9.18 (Phase 16) placeholder の Entry debts / Entry
  facts に新 D-NNN / F-008 を thread。
- `structure_plan.md` の `src/runtime/wasm/` subtree を更新
  (engine / linker / marshal / trap_map / host_func / wasi
  各 zig file を foresight 追加)。
- Full draft of cw v1 → zwasm v2 feedback message:
  `private/notes/zwasm_v2_feedback.md` (gitignored, ready for
  user to forward manually).

**Wave 6 — F-NNN hardening (2026-05-24, post-audit)**:

User identified that the previous waves left F-NNN with too
much "informational" / "recommended" / "owner judges" flavor
— a sabotage path where future AI sessions could spin "the rule
is just a preference, smallest-diff is fine". Hardened across
the board:

- project_facts.md preamble: explicit **"⚠️ THIS FILE IS PROJECT
  LAW"** block + 5-level priority chain (project_facts >
  ROADMAP > ADR > principle > AI judgement). Anything at level
  N may only be edited to align with level N-1 or above; level
  1 (F-NNN) is edited **only** by user direction.
- Each F-001..F-008 gets a `Status: confirmed — direction of
  travel is law` label.
- F-002 strengthened: smallest-diff is no longer "tie-breaker
  not veto" (= still readable as "they're both OK, smaller wins")
  — now explicitly "finished-form ALWAYS wins; smallest-diff is
  a secondary preference applying only when candidate options
  reach the same finished form".
- CLAUDE.md § Project spirit gains the 5-level priority chain
  + the explicit ban on treating F-NNN as informational /
  tie-breaker / recommendation.
- CLAUDE.md Step 6 + § "ADR-level designs" + principle.md
  depth 2-4 branch: Devil's-advocate subagent brief now
  explicitly forbids proposing alternatives that violate any
  F-NNN; if the only finished-form-clean option requires
  violating an F-NNN, the subagent **stops and surfaces** (=
  stop condition 3 in the closed stop list).
- principle.md Structural imagination phase gains a "Scope
  boundary" subsection: imagination applies only to **open
  structural plans**; F-NNN-decreed direction is implemented,
  not re-imagined.
- structure_plan.md preamble redrafted to distinguish **decree**
  entries (F-NNN-tied — owner implements, does not re-decide)
  from **imagination** entries (★new / ★split (D-NNN) — owner
  picks shape within the F-NNN envelope).
- All D-027..D-039 structure-class debt rows tightened: "owner
  decides" → "owner decides within the F-NNN envelope (must
  honor F-…)".
- New PreToolUse hook **scripts/check_facts_immutable.sh**:
  blocks `git commit` when project_facts.md amends an F-NNN
  body without (a) a new `Revision history` entry inside the
  F-NNN block AND (b) `Project-facts-amend: F-NNN — <one-line>`
  in the commit message body. Removing an F-NNN is blocked
  unconditionally (must use Supersedes chain). Wired into
  `.claude/settings.json` PreToolUse Bash matcher.

Net effect: a future session that tries to spin "well, the
F-NNN is just a recommendation, smallest-diff is fine" hits
five overlapping barriers (project_facts preamble + CLAUDE.md
priority chain + principle.md Scope boundary + subagent brief
ban + hook physical block) before it can land.

**Follow-on (2026-05-24)**: a 6th smell — **Silent
default-shift** — landed in principle.md after the user
surfaced an instance of the same shape outside F-NNN:
`bench/quick_baseline.txt` had been included in source-bearing
commits through 025dea9 (Phase 4 critical-path entry) but the
loop silently stopped from 4.6 onward without recording the
policy change. Made the policy explicit in CLAUDE.md Step 6 +
continue skill Phase boundary "Bench sweep" (commits bda8b4d /
2ec8867), and added the smell to the catalogue so future loops
recognise the pattern *before* drifting silently. Same shape as
Reservation-as-bias and Smallest-diff bias — invisible drift
away from committed intent.

## Stopped — user requested

User instruction (2026-05-24): 「きりの良いところで止めてください」.
Last landed 4.26.b at d9bed4d (ROADMAP mark-up); gate Mac 12/12 +
OrbStack Ubuntu 11/11 green.

## Active task — §9.6 / 4.26.c (on resume)

Rename the Zig error union from `Error` to `ClojureWasmError` in
`src/runtime/error.zig` and update every `pub fn ... !Value`
signature across `src/`. Self-check: `grep -rn "error_mod.Error\b"
src/ | wc -l` returns 0 when complete. Mechanical sweep — no new
public API or behaviour change beyond the rename.

**Retrievable identifiers**:

- ROADMAP §9.6 task 4.26.c, ADR-0018 amendment 2 (f) (records
  the rename rationale: "catch surface + failing test traces name
  the project").
- Catalog already re-exports `Error` (now to-be-renamed
  `ClojureWasmError`) at `error_catalog.zig::pub const Error =
  error_mod.Error;` — the re-export becomes
  `pub const ClojureWasmError = error_mod.ClojureWasmError;`.
- After 4.26.c lands, 4.26.d (~116 setErrorFmt → raise migration)
  is the next critical-path row, split by source-tree region
  per the row text (reader → analyzer → tree_walk → macro →
  primitive → error helpers).

## Open questions / blockers

None testable from inside the loop. Recall triggers + follow-up
candidates live in [`debt.md`](./debt.md) (rows `D-005` through
`D-028`). Step 0.5 debt sweep walks them at resume; pay attention
to **D-027 / D-028** which encode the design surgery this
session's guardrail refresh anticipates.
