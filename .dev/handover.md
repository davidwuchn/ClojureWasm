## Stopped — user requested

User instruction (2026-06-13): persist the recent strategy durably, "整理を
しばらくやってください。それが完了したら止めてOK". Done: **ADR-0135**
(Wasm-component-as-namespace finished form + WIT↔clj mapping table), ROADMAP
§1.2 axis 4 (Zig-level optimisation-ceiling thesis) + §1.5 (3-track working
strategy) + §8.2 (component-as-ns), and debt **D-404–D-407** (the actionable
hooks). Resume per the Resume contract; this stop applied to that session only.

## Resume contract

- **HEAD**: `main` (`git log` is the SSOT; ≈ 16087139). All work on `main`;
  commit + `git push origin main` is the atomic Step 6 (`--force*` deny-listed).
  Gate cadence ADR-0107: per-commit smoke (background), batch the full gate ALONE
  at the ≤5 ceiling / boundary. **The full gate is now ~2 min (D-385 root-caused
  + fixed, ADR-0132) and builds `-Dwasm` throughout (ADR-0133)** — the prior
  multi-hour/timeout friction is gone. **Perf measured ONLY on a Release binary**
  (`bench/run_bench.sh --quick` / `scripts/perf.sh`), never `time zig-out/bin/cljw`
  (Debug) — `.claude/rules/perf_measure_release.md`.

- **First commit on resume: follow ROADMAP §1.5 (3-track working strategy) —
  the direction is now persisted, pick the highest-ROI track.** The 2026-06-12/13
  triage CONVERGED (pure libs load+function correctly; **13 clean fixes landed,
  D-391..D-403** — cross-ns deftype import / prefix-list libspecs / `extend` /
  IMeta·Sequential·ISeq·Indexed·IReduceInit markers / `destructure` / FQCN catch /
  data.json options / pprint dispatch / cl-format). The clean single-bug vein is
  spent; remaining gaps are host-frontier or deferred-structural. So shift from
  ad-hoc grind to the **§1.5 tracks**:
  (1) **D-405** build the standing library-conformance harness (measured
  function-level triage) → then big-bang the clojure.lang.* marker remainder
  (**D-400**: actionable = IKVReduce/IBlockingDeref need new dispatch + the D-397
  follow-ups; composites are class-facet-covered) and grow the **D-406** Tier
  boundary doc; (2) **D-407** the 3 differentiation standing-proofs (fast-Zig-
  primitive bench / Wasm-FFI demo / startup-size); (3) keep hot paths clean for the
  later perf campaign. **Wasm-component-as-namespace (D-404 / ADR-0135) is the
  north star but BLOCKED-BY zwasm's CM embedding-API freeze** — design is frozen,
  re-check the zwasm freeze each Phase boundary. SAFETY: every
  `clj` oracle batch needs `-J-Xmx2g` + bounded seqs (memory `clj_oracle_heap_cap`);
  register every new e2e in run_all.sh same-commit (memory `e2e-register-in-run-all`).

  **D-271 is NOT a mandate** (ADR-0134, value-driven re-amend): the finished form
  is full IObj/IMeta metable-ness, but a substrate joins membership ONLY when a
  real consumer PULLS it — NOT a speculative 13-substrate megaproject (the
  Progress-pressure/scope-escalation smell the user caught 2026-06-12). The first
  value-driven slice, IF taken: resolve IObj/IMeta as values + membership for the
  already-metable tags (clears the name_error); but datafy (the lone near-term
  puller) has OTHER blockers too (class/.getName, host-class extends,
  clojure.reflect), so verify the whole datafy load before committing to it.

  **State**: Phase 14 (v0.1.0 milestone) ~95% done — only 14.14 (exit-smoke + tag)
  left; user is NOT cutting the tag yet. Full gate green on Mac (317/0).

  **Paused (not abandoned)**: the §9.2.S perf campaign — cljw already WINS/parity vs
  Python on most benches; the 2 cold-losers (regex_count 1.8×, sieve 1.4×) + JIT are
  the remaining levers. Resume ONLY on explicit user direction; full state in
  `.dev/perf_v0_baseline.md` + `.dev/perf_campaign_essence.md` + `.dev/optimizations.md`.

- **Forbidden this session**: re-opening the §9.2.S perf campaign as the resume
  DEFAULT (paused — polish is the focus; resume perf only on explicit user
  direction); editing zwasm except via the F-001 finding-handling policy;
  `git push --force*`.

## Just landed — P4 lib-load triage, 8 clean fixes (2026-06-12, on `main`)

Each found via real-lib triage, verified vs the lib + clj oracle, e2e-registered,
full gate green (325/0): **D-391** cross-ns deftype `:import` (hiccup renders
clj-identical) · **D-392** prefix-list libspecs both forms (potemkin, data.xml) ·
**D-393** `clojure.core/extend` runtime fn (tools.reader) · **D-394** IMeta deftype
marker · **D-395** Sequential/ISeq deftype markers w/ real dispatch (instaparse) ·
**D-396** `clojure.core/destructure` port (kezban; 11 shapes clj-matched) · **D-397**
Indexed marker (1-arity nth, rough edges scoped out) · **D-398** FQCN exception catch
(`java.lang.AssertionError` + reflective family). Infra: the e2e-registration trap
(smoke passes an orphan, full gate's check_e2e_reach fails it) caught + fixed +
memory'd (`e2e-register-in-run-all`). Rough edges deferred not shipped half-done
(D-397 follow-ups).

## Cold-start reading order (resume)

handover → **`private/notes/polish-priority-audit.md`** (the prioritized polish
wiring P1-P5) → `.claude/rules/clj_diff_sweep.md` + `.claude/rules/accepted_divergences.md`
(the F-011 sweep + classify discipline) → `.dev/debt.yaml` (D-210 floor / D-271 /
D-273 / D-232 / D-321/322/239) → `.dev/v0_v1_feature_parity.md` (P3 ns-backfill SSOT)
→ `.dev/accepted_divergences.yaml` (AD ledger). clj oracle = `~/Documents/OSS/clojure/`
(spec) + `clj -M -e` (`timeout 20`, bound seqs); v0 ref `~/Documents/MyProducts/ClojureWasm/`.
