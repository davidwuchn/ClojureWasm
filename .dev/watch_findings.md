# Watch findings — defer / re-evaluate ledger

> Per Wave 16 design (2026-05-26): every "defer to watch" decision the
> autonomous loop makes during review / planning / Step-0.6 re-laying
> lands a row here. Pre-empts the **Defer-to-amnesia smell** by giving
> each watch a tracked revisit predicate. Audit reads this file every
> `/continue` Step 0.5 sweep + at Phase boundary.

## How an entry is created

When the loop says "defer" / "watch" / "fix later" — in code review,
in a Step 6 self-audit, in a Step 0.6 re-laying, in a survey amend, in
a per-task note design-judgement section — write a row here in the
same edit. Empty defer (= no row) is the smell.

## Row schema

| Field           | Meaning                                                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID              | `W-NNN` (zero-padded 3 digits, time-ordered).                          |
| Source          | Commit SHA + section / file:line where the defer was decided.          |
| Finding         | What the loop saw, in one sentence.                                    |
| Defer rationale | Why deferring is the right call right now (cost / scope / dependency). |
| Revisit trigger | Present-tense, testable predicate. Same shape as debt.md Status.       |
| Last reviewed   | Date (YYYY-MM-DD).                                                     |

## Audit consumption

- `/continue` Step 0.5 sweep: walk every row whose `Last reviewed > 14
  days ago` AND re-evaluate the `Revisit trigger`. If true, escalate to
  active work; otherwise refresh `Last reviewed`.
- `audit_scaffolding` E2.8 check at Phase boundary: count + list rows
  whose triggers have fired.
- A row whose finding has been promoted to a real cycle / commit gets
  moved to the `## Discharged` section with the SHA.

## Conventions

- Append-only history. A row that gets resolved moves to `## Discharged`
  with the SHA, not deleted.
- Multiple findings from the same review session may share a Source SHA
  — that's fine; the ID is per finding.
- A `Defer rationale` of "no time / will get to it" is the
  Defer-to-amnesia smell — flesh out the real cost or escalate.
- `Revisit trigger` MUST be testable. "When relevant" is not testable.
