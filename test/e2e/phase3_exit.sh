# Pin Phase-3's exit criteria as a focused end-to-end gate. ROADMAP
# §9.5 task 3.14 promises:
#
#   (defn f [x] (+ x 1)) (f 2)                                       → 3
#   (try (throw (ex-info "boom" 0))
#        (catch ExceptionInfo e (ex-message e)))                     → "boom"
#
# The `data` argument to `ex-info` is an integer placeholder rather
# than the canonical empty map literal `{}` — see ADR 0002
# (`.dev/decisions/0002_phase3_exit_no_map_literal.md`): map literals
# are scoped to Phase 5 alongside HAMT / persistent collections, so
# the smoke uses any non-nil Value to verify the try/throw/catch +
# ex-info round-trip without dragging Phase-5 work into Phase 3.
#
# Both forms also appear in `phase3_cli.sh` alongside many plumbing
# cases. This script is **only** the two exit-form assertions, kept
# narrow so a Phase-3 regression is unambiguous about which gate
# slipped.
