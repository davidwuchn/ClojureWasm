# test/e2e/phase16_wasm_engine_select.sh — ADR-0200 JIT-engine adoption smoke.
# Exercises per-instance engine selection at the cljw surface:
# `(wasm/load path {:engine :jit/:interp})` + `wasm/call`. Asserts the GPR export
# is byte-identical jit==interp (the F-012 differential discipline applied to engine
# choice), the SIMD body runs on the JIT (end-to-end through exportFuncSig, the JIT
# arm zwasm shipped @5b6449779 / from_cljw_02), the SIMD body traps catchably on
# interp (SIMD is JIT-only — to_cljw_03), and the no-opts default rides interp.
#
# Like phase16_wasm_ffi.sh this is OPT-IN: it builds/uses the `-Dwasm` binary (which
# resolves zwasm via the relative-path build.zig.zon experiment), so it is NOT in the
# default per-commit gate's step list while F-001 keeps the default gate zwasm-free.
