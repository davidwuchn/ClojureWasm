# Phase 14 §9.16 row 14.13 (3) — the `binding` special form (ADR-0055).
# cw v1's dynamic-binding runtime (env.zig BindingFrame + Var.deref) was
# wired but unreachable; `binding` is the analyzer + dual-backend arm
# that drives it. Happy-path rebind/restore/nest is covered by the
# differential test (src/lang/diff_test.zig — both backends agree); this
# Layer-2 suite covers the CLI error surface, which needs no production
# dynamic var. The happy-path CLI story lands with `cljw.error/with-context`
# (the same row's next deliverable) once *error-context* — cw v1's first
# Zig-registered dynamic var — exists.
