;; ADR-0135 Amendment 1 — the STATIC `ns` `:require` form for a Wasm component
;; (CLJS/CLJD string-libspec lineage). `["x.wasm" :as g]` desugars (in the `ns`
;; special form) to `(cljw.wasm/require-component-libspec …)` — the same worker the
;; dynamic `cljw.wasm/require-component` macro uses. A component's exports become
;; callable Vars, indistinguishable from normal Clojure fns. Run under `-Dwasm`.
