;; FIX-4 wasm-error taxonomy: every wasm-surface error is a CATCHABLE cljw
;; exception (not an internal_error / exit 70). Each case evaluates a failing
;; wasm/load or wasm/call inside a (catch …); the body returns "NOT-CAUGHT" when
;; no throw happened, so the e2e asserts every line says CAUGHT and the process
;; stays exit-0. A couple of cases pin the SPECIFIC host class so the Kind
;; mapping (value_error→IllegalArgumentException, type_error→ClassCastException,
;; arity_error→ArityException) is locked, not just "some Throwable".
