# D-096 DISCHARGE regression — println/print/prn side-effect output now
# reaches stdout in -e mode and interleaves correctly with the runner's
# result-print. Root cause was two independent std.Io.File.stdout()
# writers (println's + runner's) each flushing from file offset 0, so the
# result-print clobbered the println output. Fix: a single shared
# rt.stdout writer (runtime.zig) the app entry points set and println/
# print/prn write through. These assertions FAILED before the fix
# (println output was lost; the runner's `nil` was all that survived).
