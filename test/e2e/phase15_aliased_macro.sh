# test/e2e/phase15_aliased_macro.sh — a macro called through an `:as` alias
# (`m/some-macro`) must be macroexpanded by the analyzer, exactly as the
# fully-qualified form (`mlib.core/some-macro`) already is.
#
# Regression: the analyzer's macro-detection path (`resolveMaybe`) resolved a
# qualified head with a bare `env.findNs(ns)` that does NOT translate require
# aliases, so `m/pick` fell through to a plain function call and its raw
# argument was analyzed as an ordinary symbol → "Unable to resolve symbol".
# Found via test/conformance/verified_projects/qbits.ex (`ex/try+ … (catch-data …)`). The
# fix mirrors `analyzeSymbol`: alias-translate, then own-interns-only (D-261).
# Layer 2 (e2e CLI).
