# §9.16 row 14.14 part (a) — Phase 14 / v0.1.0 exit smoke. One hit per
# v0.1.0 subcommand / surface to confirm the release cut is healthy.
# Deep per-surface coverage lives in the dedicated phase14_*.sh scripts
# (repl / nrepl / cljw_build / render_error / future_promise_delay /
# accessors / …); this is the consolidated "everything still starts and
# runs at the tag" check the release row calls for.
#
# nrepl is exercised by phase14_nrepl.sh (bencode driver); a shell smoke
# can't speak bencode cleanly, so it is referenced there, not re-driven.
