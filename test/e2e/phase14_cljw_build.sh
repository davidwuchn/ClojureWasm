# Phase 14 §9.16 row 14.11 — D-100(b) `cljw build`. Compile a Clojure
# source to a serialized bytecode payload embedded in a copy of the cljw
# binary (Deno-style "CLJC" trailer, ADR-0034 + amendment 1/2), then run
# the produced self-contained binary. Exercises:
#   - fn_val constant serialization (the `greet` fn — ADR-0034 am2)
#   - the interleaved per-chunk startup run (chunk 2 calls `greet` def'd
#     in chunk 1 — EnvelopeIterator)
#   - the `"CLJC"` artifact trailer (frame/extract)
#
# Layer 2 (e2e CLI) per ADR-0021.
