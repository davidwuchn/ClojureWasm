# cljw.wasm/require-component (a thin Clojure layer over the wasm/ primitives +
# clojure.core/intern). Exercises: :as ns creation, export-name cleanup
# (#[constructor]/#[method] markers stripped), cached-handle reuse, resource chain.

# OPT-IN, like phase16_wasm_component.sh: builds `-Dwasm` and is NOT in the default
# per-commit gate. During the local-accumulation phase the zwasm dep resolves via
# the RELATIVE-path zon (sibling ../zwasm_from_scratch with REQ-7), so Mac-local.
