# test/e2e/phase15_ns_binding_roundtrip.sh — *ns*/current_ns binding round-trip
# (ADR-0085 Commit 1, D-232). `current_ns` is a materialised view of `*ns*`:
# `(binding [*ns* *ns*] (in-ns 'tmp) …)` rebinds the *ns* thread binding (not
# the root), and on frame pop `current_ns` restores to the outer ns — so the
# NEXT top-level form resolves there again. This is the prerequisite for
# clojure.test-helper's temp-ns / eval-in-temp-ns. clj-grounded. Layer 2.
