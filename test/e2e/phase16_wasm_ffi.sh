# test/e2e/phase16_wasm_ffi.sh — polyglot Wasm FFI smoke + leak guard (ADR-0099,
# D-259 (b)). Builds the `-Dwasm` binary (which resolves zwasm via the relative-
# path build.zig.zon), loads a Zig→Wasm module, calls an export, and asserts BOTH
# the correct result AND that the DebugAllocator reports NO leak on exit — i.e. the
# `.wasm_module` GC finaliser tears down the zwasm triple instead of leaking.
#
# This is the wasm-FFI regression guard the default gate otherwise lacks. It is
# OPT-IN: it builds `-Dwasm` itself (so it does pull in zwasm), which is why it is
# NOT in the default per-commit gate's step list — run it explicitly
# (`bash test/e2e/phase16_wasm_ffi.sh`) or in the wasm-aware gate. Keeping it out
# of the default run_all step list preserves F-001 (the default gate never
# resolves zwasm); this script opts into the relative-path zwasm tree on purpose.
