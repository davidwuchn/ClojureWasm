# Phase 7 §9.9 row 7.11 — D-077 catch-class hierarchy + analyzer-time
# unknown-class rejection. Discharges the silent-default-shift smell
# where `(catch ClassName e ...)` with any class other than
# `ExceptionInfo` used to silently become dead code.
#
# Cycle 2 wired both backends through `host_class.matches` so the
# parent-chain walk works (Throwable / Exception / RuntimeException /
# ExceptionInfo). Cycle 3 added the analyzer-time `catch_class_unknown`
# raise so the failure mode is loud, not silent.
