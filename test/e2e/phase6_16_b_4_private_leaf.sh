# Phase 6.16.b-4 sub-cycle a — D-071 Part 3 closeout.
#
# After landing this cycle the 6 `-*-eager` leaves (currently parked
# as public builtins) live in `clojure.core/` with
# `.private = true`. core.clj's wrappers (`map`, `filter`, etc.)
# resolve them as same-ns Vars; user-ns callers cannot reach them
# via the `clojure.core/-foo-eager` qualified path.
#
# ADR-0033 D4 + analyzer infra at src/eval/analyzer/analyzer.zig
# L368-382 (cross-ns private check) — this test exercises the user-
# visible end of the chain.
