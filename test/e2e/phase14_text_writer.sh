# cljw-native Writer VALUE foundation (text_io.zig), before the *out*/*err* root
# flip. Exercises the rt/ prims directly: __string-writer / __stdout-writer /
# __writer->str + the write/append/flush/close method_table (string content +
# int-codepoint arm + chainable append). The root flip + with-out-str rewrite
# are build-step 2; the reader value is build-step 3.
