#
# ROADMAP §9.7 / 5.16 — Phase 5 exit smoke. Runs a small set of
# Phase-5-feature cases against the cljw CLI and asserts that the
# evaluator prints the expected Clojure surface text.
#
# Scope adjustments (per Phase 5 actual landings):
# - `(get {:a 1} :a)` and `(reduce + (range 1e6))` from the
#   ROADMAP §9.7 5.16 text depend on clojure.core collection ops
#   that Phase 6+ will ship; they are not part of Phase 5 surface.
# - The `9223372036854775807` Long/MAX_VALUE form requires Phase 7
#   Java interop (`Long/MAX_VALUE` static-field access); the
#   equivalent reachable in Phase 5 is the `9223372036854775807N`
#   BigInt-literal form (per 5.10.d).
# - VM backend currently raises NotImplemented for deftype / ctor /
#   field-access nodes (per ADR-0030's Phase 5 narrowing); the
#   Evaluator.compare line in ROADMAP §9.7 5.16 is satisfied only
#   for the non-deftype cases.
