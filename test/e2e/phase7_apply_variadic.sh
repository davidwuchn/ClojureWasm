# Phase 7 §9.9 row 7.9 — `apply` variadic-callee bind-direct fast-path
# (D-072, ADR-0042).
#
# The ADR-0042 gate fires when:
#   - callee f.tag() == .fn_val
#   - f.variadic != null AND f.variadic.arity == leading.len
#   - trailing tag in {.list, .cons, .chunked_cons, .lazy_seq, .nil}
# applyFn then passes args[1..] = [leading..., trailing] straight
# through; callFunction's rest-pack gate binds trailing to the
# `& rest` slot without realising or cons-wrapping. Other shapes
# (fixed-arity callee, builtin, keyword-as-fn, vector / non-seq
# trailing) take the eager-spread fallback.
#
# Diff_test (`src/lang/diff_test.zig`) locks the equivalence on
# both backends; this e2e exercises the CLI surface.
