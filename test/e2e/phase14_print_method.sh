# D-370 / ADR-0127 — `print-method` user-extensible print multimethod. The native
# pr/prn/print/pr-str path consults `print-method` behind an any-override dirty flag;
# `(defmethod print-method T [o w] …)` customises T's printing, including nested in a
# native collection (ADR-0127 B2 per-element consult). Validates:
#   - a direct override fires on pr / pr-str;
#   - the no-override case is byte-identical to the native render (zero regression);
#   - a user method recursing `(print-method child w)` lands on the native default;
#   - B2(b-ii): an override-typed value NESTED in a native vector / map renders via
#     the override (clj per-element recursion parity);
#   - the writer handle works inside with-out-str (the active sink is wrapped).
