# java.util.regex.Pattern/quote — wraps a string in \Q…\E so it matches
# literally as a regex (regex metacharacters lose their meaning). The first
# real feature gap the library ladder found at cuerdas rung 8 (capitalize et
# al. build literal patterns via Pattern/quote). cljw's regex engine already
# honors \Q…\E; only this static-method surface was an empty reservation.
#
# Assertions are behavioural (`=` against the expected raw string, and
# re-find matching) rather than pr-str form, to avoid shell + print
# backslash-escaping ambiguity.
