# "already loaded" off rt.loaded_libs, NOT mappings.count(). The eager bootstrap
# pre-registers its namespaces in loaded_libs (markFilesLoaded), so (require 'eager-ns)
# is a true no-op: it does NOT re-parse the embedded source, which would rebind every
# var to a fresh identity. This guards the pre-register prerequisite — without it the
# new guard would re-load an already-eager ns on every require.
