# Phase B #5 (STM) step (i) — the single-ref LockingTransaction slice:
# (dosync ...) + (ref-set r v) + (alter r f & args), single thread.
# Multi-ref lock ordering, retry-on-conflict + concurrent serializability,
# commute, and ensure are later increments (#5-ii .. #5-v). The engine is
# `runtime/concurrency/lock_tx.zig`; the surface is `lang/primitive/stm.zig`.
