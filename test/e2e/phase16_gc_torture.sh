# test/e2e/phase16_gc_torture.sh — GC torture regression guard (D-250 / D-251).
#
# Runs representative programs under CLJW_GC_TORTURE=1 (force a stop-the-world
# collect at every VM back-edge poll, post-bootstrap) and asserts they still
# produce the correct value. This locks the two GC fixes the torture mode
# surfaced:
#   - Function.header forced to offset 0 (D-251 layout class) — without it the
#     mark walk OOB-crashes on every .clj fn.
#   - the .fn_val GC trace that marks closure_bindings (D-251 rooting class) —
#     without it a fn's captured GC values are swept under collect.
#
# Scope: only the cases that are torture-clean today. The remaining D-251
# rooting gaps (transducer/interpose seq intermediates, protocol-machinery
# values) are NOT yet covered — adding them here is the close-out test for
# those fixes.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# D-244 #4 — ALLOC-driven torture (CLJW_GC_TORTURE_ALLOC=1 forces a STW collect
# inside EVERY gc.alloc). Stricter than the back-edge torture above: it catches a
# multi-alloc collection BUILDER that holds an intermediate NODE (*TailNode /
# *HamtNode / *Cons — NOT a Value) in an unrooted Zig local across the next
# alloc. The fabrication no-collect region (ADR-0150) brackets each builder so a
# mid-builder collect is DEFERRED (correct under F-006 non-moving mark-sweep).
#
# SCOPE: these are pure SYNCHRONOUS builders (no eval reentry). The complementary
# class — a collect during an eval-REENTRANT lazy-seq realization / reduce over a
# RANGE source (e.g. `(into {} (map f (range N)))`) — is D-244 #4b, FIXED
# 2026-06-17: `range.seqChunk` left its `ChunkBuffer` unrooted across the tail
# `make` + `ChunkedCons` allocs, and `-take-eager` walked a seq into an untraced
# gpa `ArrayList` with an unrooted cursor — both now bracket the fabrication
# no-collect region. The #4b regression cases are the `#4b` block below.
#
# Probes are SMALL/EAGER (alloc-torture = O(allocs) full collects; large or
# lazy-seq realizations are deliberately avoided) and assert STRUCTURE, not
# set/map print order (AD-001). A missed builder bracket trips one of these →
