# test/e2e/phase16_gc_torture.sh — GC torture regression guard (D-250 / D-251).
#
# Runs representative programs under CLJW_GC_TORTURE=1 (force a stop-the-world
# collect at every VM back-edge poll, post-bootstrap) and asserts they still
# produce the correct value. This locks the two GC fixes the torture mode
# surfaced:
#   - Function.header forced to offset 0 (D-251 layout class) — without it the
#     mark walk OOB-crashes on every .clj fn.
#   - the .fn_val GC trace that marks closure_bindings (D-251 rooting class) —
#     without it a fn's captured GC values are swept under collect.
#
# Scope: only the cases that are torture-clean today. The remaining D-251
# rooting gaps (transducer/interpose seq intermediates, protocol-machinery
# values) are NOT yet covered — adding them here is the close-out test for
# those fixes.
