# Per-class Java-completeness corpus (F-014 / ADR-0137)

Each `<Class>.txt` here is the **commonly-used surface** of one in-scope Java
class, captured as `expr` / `;;=> <output>` golden pairs that cljw reproduces
*and* the `clj` oracle agrees with. This operationalises **F-014 clause 2**
(per-class completeness when touched) as a real gate, per **ADR-0137 Axis-2**
(DA Alt 2 — oracle-derived per-class corpus).

## Why this exists (vs. a hand-maintained `methods:` list)

A hand-list of "methods we wired" only catches *drift*, never *under-scoping* —
it cannot tell you about the method you forgot to wire. The `clj` oracle knows
the whole JVM surface, so a corpus enumerated from the **frequency-filtered**
common surface (see below) fails the gate when clj answers a method and cljw
does not. That catches the partial-class trap F-014 forbids ("a partial class is
a worse trap than an absent one").

## How a corpus is built

1. Enumerate the class's common surface from the JVM public-instance methods,
   **filtered by real-world frequency** —
   `private/clojure_frequent_java_interop/00a_frequency_overview.md`
   (§2 class frequency, §5 instance-method frequency, derived from the
   `~/Documents/OSS/clojure-corpus` 228-repo scan).
2. Write one value-expr per method (with realistic args + a few edge cases) to
   a scratch file.
3. `bash scripts/clj_diff_sweep.sh <file> --class-corpus <Class>` — runs every
   expr through both cljw and clj, and appends only the **matching** pairs here.
   Any DIFF is a completeness gap: fix cljw (the common case) or, if the method
   is an intentional divergence, record an `AD-NNN` and leave it OUT of the
   corpus (the AD pin locks it instead).

## How it is gated

`scripts/check_corpus_regression.sh` scans both `clj_corpus/` (general
behaviour) and `class_corpus/` (this), re-running each `expr` through cljw only
and failing on any drift. It is part of the per-commit **smoke** gate
(`corpus_regression` step in `test/run_all.sh`), so a regression or a newly
under-scoped class surfaces immediately.

## What is deliberately NOT in a corpus

A method whose cljw behaviour intentionally diverges from clj (an accepted
divergence) is locked by its `AD-NNN` pin in `.dev/accepted_divergences.yaml`,
not by a corpus line. Examples on the String/Object surface: `.hashCode`
(AD-009, cljw value-hash ≠ JVM polynomial), `.getClass` (AD-003, simple name),
and nil-receiver method calls (error-format differs per F-011).

On the java.util container surface:
- `(.remove al (int i))` index-remove vs value-remove: cljw cannot distinguish
  `remove(int)` from `remove(Object)` (F-005 int/Long collapse) and always does
  value-remove — documented in `ArrayList.zig`. Corpus uses a non-integer element
  to test the unambiguous value-remove parity.
- `.toString` of an ArrayList/HashMap renders the cljw host-instance opaque form
  (`#<cljw.java.util.ArrayList>`), not clj's `[1, 2]` — the uniform host-object
  print. `(vec al)` / `(into {} hm)` give the clj-matching content.
- `.keySet` / `.values` return a cljw seq, not a JVM `Set`/`Collection` view
  (AD-032); corpus sorts them since hash order differs from clj (AD-001 family).

On the boxing / Character surface:
- `Double/MIN_VALUE` prints `5.0E-324` vs clj `4.9E-324` — the same f64 bits
  (the smallest denormal, `2^-1074`); only the shortest-decimal rendering of the
  denormal differs (a float-formatting edge, not a value divergence).
- `Character/isSpaceChar` is not wired (errors): it is the Unicode
  SPACE_SEPARATOR category, distinct from `.isWhitespace` and rare in Clojure —
  outside the common surface (an approximation would be a silent semantic bug).

## Status

Landed: `String` (44), `Object` (15, universal `.toString`/`.equals`),
`Throwable` (15, the exception family's `.getMessage`/`.getLocalizedMessage`/
`.getCause`/`.getData` on the shared `.ex_info` descriptor), `Pattern` (7,
`.pattern`/`/compile`/`/quote`/`/matches`) + `Matcher` (11, `.find`/`.group`/
`.start`/`.end`/`.groupCount`/`.matches`/`.lookingAt`/`.reset`), `Math` (52
statics — abs/sqrt/cbrt/pow/round/floor/ceil/rint, exact-arith, log/exp family,
full trig, hypot/signum/copySign/ulp/IEEEremainder + PI/E; already complete, the
corpus just locks it), `ArrayList` (17, add/get/set/size/isEmpty/contains/indexOf/
remove/addAll/clear + seq/vec/count) + `HashMap` (18, put/get/containsKey/
containsValue/getOrDefault/putIfAbsent/remove/keySet/values/clear + into),
`StringBuilder` (15, append all types + sub-range, toString/length/isEmpty/
charAt/deleteCharAt/insert/setLength/reverse), and the boxing/`Character` family
`Long` (19) + `Integer` (19) + `Double` (15) + `Boolean` (11) + `Character` (13)
— parse/valueOf/toString/radix/bit-ops/predicates/case-fold (Long/Integer/Boolean
already complete; Double gained `isFinite`, Character gained `isAlphabetic`/
`toString`), `UUID` (8, fromString/toString + getMostSignificantBits/
getLeastSignificantBits/version/variant/compareTo — instance accessors were
missing) and `Random` (6, **seeded** — cljw reproduces Java's exact LCG
sequence for nextInt/nextLong/nextBoolean, a strong parity).

The remaining in-scope bare classes are tracked by **D-431**.

> Note: `(Math/scalb 1.0 3)` is excluded — clj raises a COMPILE error ("More
