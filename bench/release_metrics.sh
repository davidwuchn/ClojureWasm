#
# The number we lock is BINARY SIZE: it is deterministic given a Zig version +
# target (anyone re-running this gets the same bytes), unlike cold start which
# varies by machine and filesystem cache. We report two builds: ReleaseSafe (the
# recommended release build — optimised WITH safety checks) and ReleaseSmall (the
# size floor). Cold start is a secondary, machine-dependent figure.
#
# Usage:  bash bench/release_metrics.sh
# Needs:  Zig 0.16 on PATH (direnv / nix develop); optionally `hyperfine`.
