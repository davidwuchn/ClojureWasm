# Real-world library compatibility ladder

Ranked by pure-Clojure degree (1 = zero host interop, easiest/earliest;
5 = threads / java.io / reflection-heavy). See `README.md` for the method,
the load mechanism (`-cp` manual classpath), and the status vocabulary.

Probed on cljw built from `cw-from-scratch` (2026-06-06). Rows marked
**loads / partial / fails** were actually `require`'d; rows marked
**not-probed** are static source inspection only. As of Stage 1.2,
deps.edn resolution works (`:paths`/`:local/root`/`:aliases`/`:git/url`),
so rungs are now probed via real **deps.edn git coordinates**, not just
`-cp` (rung 4 below was the first such probe).

| rank | lib                        | version       | pure-degree | status     | first-blocking-gap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Notes per rung

- **Rungs 1–3 (loads, degree 1):** the ladder head is green. `medley`,
  `math.combinatorics`, and `tools.cli` all `require` and run correctly on
  cljw today with only a manual classpath. This is the concrete evidence that
  cljw's `clojure.core` surface (protocols, records, transducers, sorted
  collections, metadata, regex, reduce-kv) covers a real pure-Clojure library
  end to end.
- **Rung 8 (cuerdas, partial):** loads after its `cuerdas.regexp` dependency
  is laid out, but `capitalize` (and other fns) hit
  `(java.util.regex.Pattern/quote ...)` — a static Java-class method call cljw
  does not resolve. This is the first *real* feature gap the ladder found, as
  opposed to a missing-resolver blocker.
- **Rungs 5, 9–14 (NEEDS-ROW):** static inspection shows each touches a Java
  surface cljw does not yet provide (seeded RNG, StAX XML, `java.io`
  reader/writer, Jackson, threads). These are the honest next gaps; the main
  loop converts each `NEEDS-ROW:` into a `debt.yaml` row classified against
  the Java-tier SSOT.
- **Rungs 13, 15 (not pure):** kept as boundary markers so the ladder makes
  explicit *where* the pure-Clojure frontier ends — they will not load without
  the underlying Java library, regardless of cljw progress.

## NEEDS-ROW gap summary (for the main loop)

These are candidate `debt.yaml` rows — the FIRST real blocker each library
hits. Do not edit `debt.yaml` from this doc; the main loop creates the rows.

1. `NEEDS-ROW: java.util.regex.Pattern static method interop (Pattern/quote)` — cuerdas rung 8, **confirmed by probe** (partial load).
2. ~~`NEEDS-ROW: java.util.Random seeded RNG`~~ — data.generators rung 5. **Rowed 2026-06-07 → D-289** (probed: fails at ns-load on the seeded ctor; stateful-native-object capability, sibling to D-288).
3. `NEEDS-ROW: javax.xml.stream StAX reader/writer` — data.xml rung 9.
4. `NEEDS-ROW: java.io FileNotFoundException catch + file slurp` — instaparse rung 10.
5. `NEEDS-ROW: java.io PrintWriter/PushbackReader/StringWriter + clojure.pprint` — data.json rung 11.
6. `NEEDS-ROW: threads/executors/go-macro` — core.async rung 14 (already Campaign Stage 1.7 / Phase B).

Cross-cutting blocker (not a single row): **no deps.edn / Maven resolver
yet** (Campaign Stage 1.2). Every transitive dependency must be fetched and
laid out by hand, which is what holds the `not-probed` rows back from being
load-verified.
