# Binary size — where cljw sits among comparable runtimes

cljw ships as **one static binary** (no JVM, no install tree, no side files
— ADR-0158). This page places that binary among other language runtimes and
Wasm engines, using **measured** numbers, and states the method so the
comparison stays honest. The internal size budget + reduction levers live in
`.dev/decisions/0172_binary_size_budget_and_ledger.md`; this page is the
user-facing view.

**Method.** Each ranked runtime was downloaded from its latest official
release as of **2026-07-16**, extracted, and its executable measured with
`stat` — exact bytes, uncompressed, macOS arm64 assets wherever offered
(exceptions noted). Multi-file distributions record both the main binary and
the extracted total. Entries marked *published figure* were not re-measured
locally. cljw's own number is the shipped brew artifact.

## Reading the table

Sizes cluster into three capability layers:

1. **~0.3-3 MB — embeddable minimalists** (Lua, Janet, QuickJS, Cyber).
   Small standard libraries, no compatibility target with an existing
   ecosystem. A different class of tool, listed for scale.
2. **~5-20 MB — full runtimes as one binary.** The realistic floor for
   "a complete language + its stdlib in a single file": GraalVM's compiled
   HelloWorld floor (~6.5 MB) and wazero (a Wasm engine alone, 5.5 MB) bound
   it from below. cljw's 9.5 MB sits here — carrying both a Clojure runtime
   *and* an embedded JIT-compiling Wasm engine (for scale: wasmtime, a Wasm
   engine alone, is 51.5 MB).
3. **50-180 MB — the modern batteries-included mainstream** (Node, Deno,
   Bun, babashka, wasmtime, wasmer). This is the industry's actual
   center of gravity today.

## Caveats

- Reference platform is macOS arm64; Linux x86_64 artifacts differ slightly
  (cljw's Linux binary is within ~10%). jank had no macOS/stable release, so
  its number is the Linux prerelease.
- "Capability class" comparisons are indicative, not equivalences — a JS
  runtime, a Wasm engine, and a Clojure runtime do different jobs. The
  honest claims are the two above: smallest Clojure-family binary, and a
  full-runtime-plus-Wasm-engine inside the 5-20 MB single-binary layer.
- cljw's number is moving fast: the v1.3.1 row above is the SHIPPED release;
  the working tree already measures **7.07 MB** (−25% in one campaign:
  unwind-table strip, envelope-v7 constant pool + flate-compressed lazy
  regions and `.clj` sources, and zwasm v2.2.1's JIT-thunk collapse — a
  same-day cross-repo result). The README figure is gate-checked against
  every release build, so it cannot silently rot.
