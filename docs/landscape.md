# Where ClojureWasm sits — a map, not a scoreboard

Clojure runs in a lot of places now. Each runtime below was built for a
different job and is excellent at it. This page is a map of where they sit, not
a ranking — ClojureWasm is one young entry exploring the WebAssembly
corner, and the only numbers it claims are its own measured ones.

| Runtime            | Host / where it shines                                                                                                | Distribution                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Clojure (JVM)**  | The JVM. Mature, complete, an enormous ecosystem.                                                                     | Runs on a JVM.                           |
| **Babashka / SCI** | GraalVM native / JS. Fast-starting scripting, glue.                                                                   | Self-contained binary.                   |
| **ClojureScript**  | JavaScript. Front-end and the Node ecosystem.                                                                         | JS host.                                 |
| **jank**           | LLVM / C++. Native code and seamless C++ interop.                                                                     | Native.                                  |
| **ClojureDart**    | Dart / Flutter. Mobile and cross-platform UI.                                                                         | App bundles.                             |
| **ClojureWasm**    | Zig. Embeds a Wasm engine so Clojure calls modules from Rust/Go/C (polyglot FFI), and compiles to WebAssembly itself. | ~3 MB native binary, starts in a few ms. |

The other rows are respectful summaries of what each runtime is known for, not
evaluations. The ClojureWasm row lists only its own
[measured figures](../bench/RELEASE_METRICS.md); it does not claim to beat
anything.

## What "the WebAssembly corner" means here

Two things, which are easy to conflate:

1. **ClojureWasm compiles to WebAssembly** — the runtime is plain Zig, so a
   WebAssembly build is a natural target (a browser-only playground, a small
   Wasm function).
2. **ClojureWasm embeds a WebAssembly engine** — so a Clojure program can load a
   sandboxed module compiled from Rust, Go, Zig, or C and call it like a
   namespace. WebAssembly becomes an FFI: other languages' libraries become
   callable from Clojure, in-process and sandboxed. (See
   [`docs/examples/wasm/`](../docs/examples/wasm/).)

That second point is the part that does not have an obvious equivalent in the
other runtimes, and it is the angle ClojureWasm is exploring.

## A note on respect

Babashka and SCI made JVM-free Clojure scripting fast and ordinary; jank is
doing the hard work of native Clojure with C++ interop; ClojureDart put Clojure
on Flutter; ClojureScript has carried Clojure on the front-end for over a
decade; and the JVM remains the complete, production-proven home of the
language. ClojureWasm exists because of the path those projects cleared, and it
is exploring one more corner — not competing for the others' ground.
