# PreToolUse hook on `git commit`. Mechanically enforces the gate-cadence
# policy (.claude/rules/gate_cadence.md) so it is law, not just prose:
#
#   - NON-SOURCE commit (docs / .dev / .claude / scripts only, no src|test|
#     build.zig*): exempt. Never blocked, never counted.
#   - ADDITIVE source commit (touches src/ or test/, pure insertion — no
#     existing line removed/modified, no build.zig*): may accumulate up to
#     GATE_MAX_BATCH (default 5) since the last full gate. The 6th blocks.
#   - RISKY source commit (build.zig* touched, OR an existing src/ or test/
#     line removed/modified): requires a fresh full gate EVERY time.
#
# "Fresh full gate" = test/run_all.sh wrote .dev/.gate_pass with a
# source-state hash (scripts/gate_state_hash.sh) equal to the about-to-be-
# committed state. A matching hash both authorises the commit and resets
# the additive counter. The empirical basis: on additive coverage the full
# gate caught 0 regressions across this session that the per-feature smoke
# (`zig build` + `cljw -e` + the single e2e) had not already caught, so the
# ~50s full gate is near-pure insurance there and batching is safe; shared-
# code edits are where the gate earns its cost (regression + diff-oracle).
#
# Fail-closed: a git/python error in the shared helpers exits non-zero.

regression + dual-backend-parity risk, so the policy requires a fresh
full gate every time — no batching.
