# scripts/check_e2e_reach.sh — e2e ORPHAN guard (coverage-lie prevention).
#
# An e2e script under test/e2e/ that is NOT referenced in test/run_all.sh
# never runs in the gate — so it gives FALSE confidence (the file exists, looks
# like coverage, but gates nothing). This is the e2e sibling of
# check_test_reach.sh (which guards Zig `test {}` orphans). It surfaced
# 2026-06-02 when 5 newly-authored phase14 e2e + the pending phase14_eval were
# all unreferenced (D-196 / D-197 investigation).
#
# Fails if any test/e2e/*.sh is not referenced by name in run_all.sh, except
# the explicit ALLOWLIST (e2e for not-yet-implemented features, intentionally
# parked until the feature lands — each MUST cite a debt row here).
#
# Usage: bash scripts/check_e2e_reach.sh [--gate]   # --gate => exit 1 on orphan
