#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/check_compat_members.sh — the compat_tiers member-truth gate
# (ADR-0174 D9, F-013 clause 3 / F-014 clause 2).
#
# data/compat_tiers.yaml's per-class `methods:` / `static_fields:` lists
# rotted in BOTH directions before ADR-0174 (Long/MAX_VALUE worked but was
# unlisted; MessageDigest/getInstance was listed but absent). A one-time
# refresh re-rots without a mechanical gate, so this script re-derives the
# code truth from `(cljw.internal/__dump-host-classes)` (every registered
# host descriptor's static fields + members, incl. the per-tag native
# descriptors that carry String/Long instance methods) and asserts, for
# every yaml class that declares a `files.surface`:
#
#   (a) every yaml-listed member EXISTS on the registered descriptor
#       (no over-claim — the D-177/MessageDigest lie class);
#   (b) every descriptor member is yaml-listed (no silent unlisted
#       member — the Long/MAX_VALUE rot class); `<init>` is exempt
#       (constructors are class_corpus territory, not the member list);
#   (c) no `opaque_members:` entry is actually implemented (an OPAQUE
#       row claims "deliberately absent" — implementing it must flip
#       the row back to `methods:`).
#
# Exit 0 = ledger honest; 1 = at least one drift, listed per class.
