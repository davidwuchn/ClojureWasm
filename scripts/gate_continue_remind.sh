[gate reminder — do not stop]

A test gate just launched. The loop's only stop is the user's
explicit directive (CLAUDE.md § The only stop) — an "awaiting the
gate" turn-end with nothing pending is the de-facto stall to avoid.
While the gate runs, prep the NEXT task with READS + notes (working
tree untouched until the gate is green and the prior commit lands);
on completion, commit and roll into the next unit. CAUTION: do NOT
dispatch a CPU-heavy subagent (a Step-0 survey) concurrently with the
gate — it contends with the perf-threshold steps (e.g. cold_start)
and causes FALSE failures; dispatch surveys AFTER the gate completes.
End a turn only with a still-running harness task OR a
ScheduleWakeup(prompt:"continue") long backstop — never a bare
recap. Auto-compaction is transparent; size is never a reason to stop.
