# scripts/clj_diff_sweep.sh — F-011 differential sweep harness.
#
# Runs each Clojure VALUE expression through both `clj` (the oracle) and
# `cljw`, then reports OK / DIFF per expression. This is the mechanised
# form of the manual `for e in …; cljw vs clj` loops the quality loop kept
# hand-writing (see `.claude/rules/clj_diff_sweep.md`).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/clj_diff_sweep.sh EXPRS_FILE        # one bare expr per line
#   printf '%s\n' '(+ 1 2)' '(map inc [1])' | bash scripts/clj_diff_sweep.sh -
#   bash scripts/clj_diff_sweep.sh EXPRS_FILE --corpus regex   # append OKs
#
# Input format: ONE value-producing expression per line, NOT wrapped in
# `prn` (the harness wraps it). Blank lines and `;`-comment lines are
# skipped. Example file:
#   (map inc [1 2 3])
#   (clojure.string/upper-case "ab")
#
# Methodology (memory `clj_diff_sweep_methodology` + this header):
#   - clj is run ONCE over a batch (one `(prn EXPR)` per line) — fast, and
#     a multi-line clj error never desyncs the line mapping because each
#     prn is on its own line.
#   - cljw is run ONE expression at a time (`cljw -e '(prn EXPR)'`, line 1)
#     — per-expr is the reliable cljw surface; a batch would interleave.
#   - Both are `timeout`-wrapped (orphan_prevention.md). Bound any seq
#     producer with `(take N …)`; an unbounded `(range)` realises forever.
#   - SET / MAP literals print in hash order, which legitimately differs
#     from clj — a `#{…}` / non-sorted `{…}` DIFF is usually NOT a bug.
#     Check F-NNN (project_facts) before "fixing" an apparent divergence
#     (e.g. `+`/`*` overflow auto-promote is INTENTIONAL per F-005).
#
# Exit code: 0 if every expression matched, 1 if any DIFF (so it can gate
# a corpus regression run).

# --- clj batch (one prn per line) ---
# A qualified symbol like `clojure.set/union` needs its namespace required
# first — clj does NOT auto-load it, and an un-required reference aborts the
# WHOLE batch at line 1 (every later prn then maps to <clj-missing>, a false
# all-DIFF signal). Auto-detect every `dotted.ns/` prefix in the exprs and
# emit a require ahead of the prn lines. The requires are NOT prn-wrapped, so
# they add no stdout line and the clj_lines[i] ↔ exprs[i] mapping is preserved.
# A non-requireable prefix (e.g. a Java FQCN `java.util.UUID/…`) is swallowed
# by the try/catch so it never aborts the batch — Java classes need no require.

# MEMORY SAFETY (2026-06-12 incident): an unbounded seq producer that slips into
# a sweep line (e.g. `(take-nth 0 coll)` → clj's infinite `(first…)` repeat) is
# realized for the FULL `timeout 60` window by `(prn …)`. Without a heap cap an
# uncapped JVM grew until it exhausted ~138 GB of system memory + swap. `-J-Xmx2g`
# bounds the blast radius: a runaway seq now hits a JVM OutOfMemoryError in seconds
# (the process dies) instead of consuming all system RAM. 2g is ample for any legit
# batch (a few dozen small values). The `(take N …)`-bound-every-producer rule
# (orphan_prevention.md) is still the primary discipline; this is the backstop.
