# check_test_reach.sh — flag .zig files that ship `test {...}`
# blocks but are not reachable from `src/main.zig` via the
# `@import` graph.
#
# Background: Zig 0.16 analyses top-level decls lazily. A file
# imported only via `pub const X = @import("...")` (with X
# unreferenced) is NOT pulled into the test set, and its
# `test {}` blocks silently never run. Worse, latent compile
# errors inside the file go undetected.
#
# See .claude/rules/zig_tips.md "Test discovery via @import".
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check_test_reach.sh            # informational
#   bash scripts/check_test_reach.sh --gate     # exit 1 if any
#                                               # file is unreachable
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   no unreachable test files
#   1   --gate mode: at least one unreachable test file (gate fail)
#   2   internal script error

# Test roots — every `addTest(.{ .root_module = X })` site in
# `build.zig` introduces an independent test executable whose
# analysis set starts from a different `root_source_file`. A
# `.zig` file with a `test {}` block runs ONLY if it's reachable
# from the exe whose test runner it's part of. Reaching from
# root #1 doesn't help if the file belongs to root #2.
#
# cw v1 today (Phase 6) has a single `addTest()`. The list below
# is open for extension: when a second test exe lands (spec
# runner, fuzz harness, etc.), append its root_source_file path
# here so the union BFS stays sound. zwasm v2's reciprocal
# observation surfaced this multi-test-root blind spot —
# auto-parsing `build.zig` is the future improvement, but a
# manual list is enough at cw v1's current scale and stays
# obvious in `git diff`.

reachable only from the new exe's root counts as unreachable here.
