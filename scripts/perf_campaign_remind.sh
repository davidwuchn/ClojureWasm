# PostToolUse:Bash hook. Force-injects the perf-campaign LOOKAHEAD essence
# (.dev/perf_campaign_essence.md) at every WAIT-point that is NOT already
# covered by a sibling reminder — so a wait never becomes an idle turn-end.
#
# Wait-points it catches (the gate path is owned by gate_continue_remind.sh,
# git commit by post_commit_remind.sh — excluded here to avoid double-fire):
#   - a bench launch (run_bench.sh / compare_langs.sh / record.sh)
#   - a poll-wait loop (`sleep ` inside a for/while — my "is it done yet" polls)
#   - a backgrounded long-runner (trailing `&`)
#   - the remote Ubuntu gate (also a long wait)
#
# Why: the campaign (ROADMAP §9.2.S) drifts toward idle exactly while waiting
# on background work. CLAUDE.md prose dilutes as context grows; a mechanical
# injection at the wait does not. Sibling of gate_continue_remind.sh /
# post_commit_remind.sh. The injected essence is a *don't-drift* guard, not a
# blocking gate.
#
# Inputs: stdin JSON (PostToolUse payload). stdout: JSON
# hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext fed back to Claude.

HEADER='[perf-campaign lookahead — do not idle-wait]

A background wait just started. Per the campaign essence below, this wait is
NOT idle time: pick a LOOKAHEAD task (mine v0 for the next lever, survey the next
Python-target, draft the next change into private/, re-profile) and DO it now.
Acknowledge-and-idle is the drift this guard exists to stop. ACT on it with the
same force you give the commit guards.
