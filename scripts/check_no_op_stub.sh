# Patterns considered no-op stubs:
#   1. fn body that immediately returns the only argument unchanged
#   2. fn body that wraps the body argument in a no-op block
#   3. comment "no-op" or "stub" near impl without explicit ADR reference
#
# Skeleton boundary: struct definition only OR fn body that is exactly
# `return error.NotImplemented;` or `@panic("Phase N: see ADR-NNNN");`
# is allowed (see JVM_TO_ZIG §2 原則 4).
