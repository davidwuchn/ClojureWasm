# G4 gate (ADR-0102, F-013): the deftype/reify host-supertype marker set is a
# closed-set SSOT, not a hand-grown allowlist. Enforces that recognition in code
# cannot grow library-by-library (the 個別最適化 entry F-013 clause 3 forbids).
#
# SSOT-of-record: host_interfaces.yaml (reviewable closed set + derives_from).
# Single in-code read point: src/runtime/host_interface.zig (a StaticStringMap).
#
# Checks:
#   (i)  set-bound  — every name recognised in host_interface.zig has a row in
#        host_interfaces.yaml (so a name cannot be recognised without a closed-
#        set row whose derives_from justifies it as language-defined).
#   (ii) over-claim — every host_interfaces.yaml row marked `recognised: true`
#        is actually present in the code table (no row claiming coverage it
#        lacks — the anti-D-177 false-positive discipline).
#   (iii) no floating wire — every method with `status: wired` names a
#        non-empty `wires_to` (a wired method must point at a real surface).
#   (iv) yaml==zig remap equality (D-415 S1) — the yaml `methods:` maps and the
#        zig `.remap` tables DUPLICATE the same data; this diffs them so neither
#        can drift silently (the blind spot that let D-419's zig-only additions
#        pass). `-`-prefixed identity guards are excluded; Object-method-family
#        targets are matched on key-presence (yaml documents them via `wires_to`).
