# scripts/check_vm_parity.sh — VM-backend parity probe (ADR-0070 / D-196).
#
# Builds cljw with `-Dbackend=vm` (ReleaseSafe) and runs the clj-grounded
# corpus + the (now-empty) D-196 VM-parity-blocker e2e list against it.
#
# HISTORY: this probe existed to stop VM gaps being MASKED by the (then)
# tree_walk default — the per-commit gate ran e2e on tree_walk only. ALL 5
# D-196 blockers closed 2026-06-02, and **build.zig's default flipped to `vm`**
# (ADR-0070 step 4 / F-012). Post-flip the per-commit gate runs e2e on vm (the
# production default), so the masking concern this probe guarded is resolved.
#
# CURRENT ROLE (on-demand): a `-Dbackend=vm` ReleaseSafe + corpus smoke. The
# BLOCKERS list is empty (kept as the re-add point should a future VM-only
# regression need tracking). FOLLOW-UP (tracked): repurpose to exercise the
# e2e suite on the NON-default backend (`tree-walk`, the differential oracle)
# so an oracle-only e2e/rendering regression can't hide behind the vm-default
# gate — run on-demand / at Phase boundaries per ADR-0049's per-commit-cost
# concern, not as a per-commit gate.
#
# Restores the DEFAULT (vm ReleaseSafe wasm — the unified gate config)
# binary on exit.
# Usage: bash scripts/check_vm_parity.sh   # exit 0 = all green; N = N failing.

BLOCKERS=(
    # ALL D-196 blockers CLOSED 2026-06-02 — the list is empty; the probe now
    # verifies the corpus + (the absence of) regressions on -Dbackend=vm. Per
    # ADR-0070 step 4 the next cycle flips build.zig default to vm and promotes
    # this probe to a hard per-commit gate.
    # phase14_ns_directive CLOSED 2026-06-02 (D-098): op_ns_with_filter +
    # ns_filters side-table + emitLibspec loop. Pruned.
    # phase14_java_static_dispatch CLOSED 2026-06-02 (D-196 blocker 3): the
    # java-surface ctor `(java.io.File. …)` now resolves on the VM via the
    # shared special_forms.constructInstance (was deftype-only). Pruned.
    # phase14_catch_keyword CLOSED 2026-06-02 (D-014b VM lowering):
    # op_match_type_keyword parallels op_match_class. Pruned.
    # phase14_with_context + phase14_user_throw CLOSED 2026-06-02 (ADR-0071):
    # the cleanup-handler kind (op_push_cleanup / op_reraise) preserves the
    # dynamic error-context + catalog Kind through a binding / bare-try
    # unwind, matching TreeWalk's `defer`. Pruned from the blocker list.
    # NOTE: phase14_eval is NOT a VM blocker — `eval` is unimplemented on BOTH
    # backends (name_error), tracked separately as D-197. Do not add here.
