# scripts/check_vm_parity.sh — VM-backend parity probe (ADR-0070 / D-196).
#
# Builds cljw with `-Dbackend=vm` (ReleaseSafe, matching the e2e gate + the
# production-distribution config) and runs the clj-grounded corpus + the D-196
# VM-parity-blocker e2e against it, reporting the failing count. This is the
# mechanism that stops VM gaps from being MASKED by the tree_walk default (the
# per-commit gate runs e2e on tree_walk only; VM is otherwise covered by unit +
# diff_test alone). Informational while D-196 is open; on D-196 close it is
# promoted to a hard per-commit gate and build.zig flips its default to `vm`.
#
# The probe lists the D-196 blocker e2e EXPLICITLY (not a glob): a broad
# phase14 glob proved unreliable here (some sibling e2e perturbed the shared
# binary mid-run). As each blocker is closed, drop it from BLOCKERS; when the
# list is empty + corpus green, the flip lands.
#
# Restores the default (tree_walk ReleaseSafe) binary on exit.
# Usage: bash scripts/check_vm_parity.sh   # exit 0 = all green; N = N failing.
