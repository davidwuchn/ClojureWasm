# scripts/check_vm_parity.sh — NON-DEFAULT-backend e2e sweep (D-553; was the
# ADR-0070 / D-196 VM-parity probe).
#
# Builds cljw with `-Dbackend=tree_walk` (the F-012 differential-oracle
# backend; `vm` is the production default since ADR-0070 step 4) and runs the
# corpus + the FULL test/e2e suite against it — so an oracle-only e2e /
# rendering regression cannot hide behind the vm-default gate.
#
# Cadence: on-demand / Phase boundaries (ADR-0049 per-commit-cost concern),
# NEVER per-commit. Runtime ≈ one serial e2e pass (~5 min).
#
# SKIPS lists e2e steps that intrinsically exercise the DEFAULT backend
# (AOT bytecode / build pipeline) and are meaningless or false-failing on
# tree-walk; each entry carries its reason. A newly-failing step NOT in
# SKIPS is a genuine tree-walk regression — fix it, don't add it here
# without a reason.
#
# HISTORY: the D-196 blocker era (VM gaps masked by the then-tree_walk
# default) closed 2026-06-02; build.zig's default flipped to vm. This script
# then idled as a corpus-only probe until the D-553 repurpose (2026-07-06).
#
# Restores the DEFAULT (vm ReleaseSafe wasm — the unified gate config)
# binary on exit.
# Usage: bash scripts/check_vm_parity.sh   # exit 0 = all green; N = N failing.
