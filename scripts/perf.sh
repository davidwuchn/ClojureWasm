# scripts/perf.sh — THE blessed way to measure cljw runtime speed.
#
# Builds an OPTIMISED binary (ReleaseFast by default) into a SEPARATE
# prefix, then times the expression against it. The dev binary
# `zig-out/bin/cljw` is left untouched.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the principled perf guard, 2026-05-31):
#   `zig build` (no `-Doptimize`) defaults to **Debug** (fast dev
#   iteration). A Debug build of a tree-walk interpreter runs ~10-100x
#   slower than the shipped ReleaseSafe/Fast build, so timing
#   `zig-out/bin/cljw` yields MEANINGLESS perf numbers. An entire perf
#   "campaign" once chased Debug ghosts: `(count (vec (range 1e6)))`
#   read **121s in Debug** but **0.01s in ReleaseFast**; startup read
#   0.48s in Debug but ~ms in ReleaseFast (matching cw v0's ~4ms).
#   See `.claude/rules/perf_measure_release.md`.
#
# RULE: measure runtime speed ONLY through this script (or the
# ReleaseFast `bench/`). NEVER `time zig-out/bin/cljw` — that is Debug.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/perf.sh '(count (vec (range 1000000)))'   # 3 runs, ReleaseFast
#   bash scripts/perf.sh -n 5 '(reduce + (range 1e6))'     # 5 runs
#   bash scripts/perf.sh --file bench/fixtures/x.clj       # time a file
#   CLJW_PERF_MODE=ReleaseSafe bash scripts/perf.sh '...'  # match cw-v0's mode
