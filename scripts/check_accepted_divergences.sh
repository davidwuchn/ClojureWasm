#
# Auto-defense for the accepted-clj-divergence SSOT (.dev/accepted_divergences.yaml).
# An "accepted divergence" is a behaviour where cljw INTENTIONALLY differs from
# JVM Clojure (rule: .claude/rules/accepted_divergences.md). This gate makes the
# ledger trustworthy so a divergence cannot (a) be added without a justification
# or (b) drift out of sync with the docs / its pinning test.
#
# Checks:
#   1. SSOT is well-formed YAML with a non-empty `accepted:` list.
#   2. Every entry has a non-empty `derives_from` (no lazy "just accept it").
#   3. Every entry's `pin` test path(s) exist (locks the divergent cljw
#      behaviour against accidental change). Entries whose pin starts with
#      "none" are exempt (value-dependent / identity-hash cases).
#   4. COVERAGE.md's "Acceptable divergences" section points at this SSOT
#      (no duplicated prose list that could drift).
#
# Informational by default (exit 0). Pass --gate to exit 1 on a violation.
